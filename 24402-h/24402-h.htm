<p class="rgt2"><i>Washington, D. C., June 5, 1891.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have duly prepared by your direction a descriptive list of
the more important economic plants at present contained in the collection
of the Department, in such a form as will, in my opinion,
most satisfactorily meet the wants of the numerous visitors and
others interested in the work performed by the Department in this
direction, and I beg to submit the same herewith for publication.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF PLANTS.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. <span class="smcap">Abelmoschus moschatus.</span>&mdash;This plant is a native of Bengal. Its seeds were
formerly mixed with hair powder, and are still used to perfume pomatum.
The Arabs mix them with their coffee berries. In the West Indies the
bruised seeds, steeped in rum, are used, both externally and internally, as a
cure for snake bites.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Abrus precatorius.</span>&mdash;Wild liquorice. This twining, leguminous plant is a
native of the East, but is now found in the West Indies and other tropical
regions. It is chiefly remarkable for its small oval seeds, which are of a
brilliant scarlet color, with a black scar at the place where they are attached
to the pods. These seeds are much used for necklaces and other ornamental
purposes, and are employed in India as a standard of weight, under the name
of Rati. The weight of the famous Kohinoor diamond is known to have
been ascertained in this way. The roots afford liquorice, which is extracted
in the same manner as that from the true Spanish liquorice plant, the <i>Glycyrrhiza
glabra</i>. Recently the claim was made that the weather could be
foretold by certain movements of the leaves of this plant, but experimental
tests have proved its fallacy.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Abutilon indicum.</span>&mdash;This plant furnishes fiber fit for the manufacture of ropes.
Its leaves contain a large quantity of mucilage.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Abutilon venosum.</span>&mdash;This malvaceous plant is common in collections, as are
others of the genus. They are mostly fiber-producing species. The flowers
of <i>A. esculentum</i> are used as a vegetable in Brazil.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Acacia brasiliensis.</span>&mdash;This plant furnishes the Brazil wood, which yields a red
or crimson dye, and is used for dyeing silks. The best quality is that received
from Pernambuco.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Acacia catechu.</span>&mdash;The drug known as catechu is principally prepared from
this tree, the wood of which is boiled down, and the decoction subsequently
evaporated so as to form an extract much used as an astringent. The acacias
are very numerous, and yield many useful products. Gum arabic is produced
by several species, as <i>A. vera</i>, <i>A. arabica</i>, <i>A. adansonii</i>, <i>A. verek</i>, and
others. It is obtained by spontaneous exudation from the trunk and branches,
or by incisions made in the bark, from whence it flows in a liquid state, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
soon hardens by exposure to the air. The largest quantity of the gum comes
from Barbary. Gum senegal is produced by <i>A. vera</i>. By some it is thought
that the timber of <i>A. arabica</i> is identical with the Shittim tree, or wood of the
Bible. From the flowers of <i>A. farnesiana</i> a choice and delicious perfume is
obtained, the chief ingredient in many valued "balm of a thousand flowers."
The pods of <i>A. concinna</i> are used in India as a soap for washing; the leaves
are used for culinary purposes, and have a peculiarly agreeable acid taste.
The seeds of some species are used, when cooked, as articles of food. From
the seeds of <i>A. niopo</i> the Guahibo Indians prepare a snuff, by roasting the
seeds and pounding them in a wooden platter. Its effects are to produce a
kind of intoxication and invigorate the spirits. The bark of several species
is extensively used for tanning, and the timber, being tough and elastic, is
valuable for the manufacture of machinery and other purposes where great
strength and durability are requisite.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Acacia dealbata.</span>&mdash;The silver wattle tree of Australia. The bark is used for
tanning purposes. It is hardy South.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Acacia homolophylla.</span>&mdash;This tree furnishes the scented myall wood, a very
hard and heavy wood, of an agreeable odor, resembling that of violets.
Fancy boxes for the toilet are manufactured of it.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">Acacia melanoxylon.</span>&mdash;The wood of this tree is called mayall wood in New
South Wales. It is also called violet wood, on account of the strong odor it
has of that favorite flower; hence it is in great repute for making small
dressing cases, etc.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">Acacia mollissima.</span>&mdash;The black wattle tree of Australia, which furnishes a
good tanning principle. These trees were first called wattles from being
used by the early settlers for forming a network or wattling of the supple
twigs as a substitute for laths in plastering houses.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap">Acrocomia sclerocarpa.</span>&mdash;This palm grows all over South America. It is
known as the great macaw-tree. A sweetish-tasted oil, called Mucaja oil,
is extracted from the fruit and is used for making toilet soaps.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap">Adansonia digitata.</span>&mdash;The baobab tree, a native of Africa. It has been called
the tree of a thousand years, and Humboldt speaks of it as "the oldest organic
monument of our planet." Adanson, who traveled in Senegal in 1794,
made a calculation to show that one of these trees, 30 feet in diameter, must
be 5,150 years old. The bark of the baobab furnishes a fiber which is made
into ropes and also manufactured into cloth. The fiber is so strong as to give
rise to a common saying in Bengal, "as secure as an elephant bound with
baobab rope." The pulp of the fruit is slightly acid, and the juice expressed
from it is valued as a specific in putrid and pestilential fevers. The ashes of
the fruit and bark, boiled in rancid palm oil, make a fine soap.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap">Adenanthera pavonina.</span>&mdash;A tree that furnishes red sandal wood. A dye is
obtained simply by rubbing the wood against a wet stone, which is used by
the Brahmins for marking their foreheads after religious bathing. The seeds
are used by Indian jewelers as weights, each seed weighing uniformly four
grains. They are known as Circassian beans. Pounded and mixed with borax,
they form an adhesive substance. They are sometimes used as food.
The plant belongs to the <i>Leguminos&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap">Adhatoda vasica.</span>&mdash;This plant is extolled for its charcoal in the manufacture
of powder. The flowers, leaves, roots, and especially the fruit, are considered
antispasmodic, and are administered in India in asthma and intermittent
fevers.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap">&AElig;gle marmelos.</span>&mdash;This plant belongs to the orange family, and its fruit is
known in India as Bhel fruit. It is like an orange; the thick rind of the
unripe fruit possesses astringent properties, and, when ripe, has an exquisite
flavor and perfume. The fruit and other parts of the plant are used for
medicinal purposes, and a yellow dye is prepared from the skin of the fruits.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap">Agave americana.</span>&mdash;This plant is commonly known as American aloe, but it
is not a member of that family, as it claims kindred with the <i>Amaryllis</i> tribe
of plants. It grows naturally in a wide range of climate, from the plains of
South America to elevations of 10,000 feet. It furnishes a variety of products.
The plants form impenetrable fences; the leaves furnish fibers of
various qualities, from the fine thread known as pita-thread, which is used for
twine, to the coarse fibers used for ropes and cables. Humboldt describes a
bridge of upward of 130 feet span over the Chimbo in Quito, of which the
main ropes (4 inches in diameter) were made of this fiber. It is also used for
making paper. The juice, when the watery part is evaporated, forms a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
soap (as detergent as castile), and will mix and form a lather with salt water
as well as with fresh. The sap from the heart leaves is formed into pulque.
This sap is sour, but has sufficient sugar and mucilage for fermentation.
This vinous beverage has a filthy odor, but those who can overcome the
aversion to this fetid smell indulge largely in the liquor. A very intoxicating
brandy is made from it. Razor strops are made from the leaves; they are
also used for cleaning and scouring pewter.</p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap">Agave rigida.</span>&mdash;The sisal hemp, introduced into Florida many years ago,
for the sake of its fiber, but its cultivation has not been prosecuted to a commercial
success. Like many other of the best vegetable fibers found in leaves,
it contains a gummy substance, which prevents the easy separation of the
fiber from the pulp.</p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap">Aleurites triloba.</span>&mdash;The candleberry tree, much cultivated in tropical countries
for the sake of its nuts. The nuts or kernels, when dried and stuck on a
reed, are used by the Polynesians as a substitute for candles and as an article of
food; they are said to taste like walnuts. When pressed, they yield largely of
pure palatable oil, as a drying oil for paint, and known as artists' oil. The
cake, after the oil has been expressed, is a favorite food for cattle. The root
of the tree affords a brown dye, which is used to dye cloths.</p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap">Algarobia glandulosa.</span>&mdash;The mezquite tree, of Texas, occasionally reaching a
height of 25 to 30 feet. It yields a very hard, durable wood, and affords a large
quantity of gum resembling gum arabic, and answering every purpose of that
gum.</p>

<p>20. <span class="smcap">Allamanda cathartica.</span>&mdash;This plant belongs to the family of <i>Apocynace&aelig;</i>,
which contains many poisonous species. It is often cultivated for the beauty
of its flowers; the leaves are considered a valuable cathartic, in moderate
doses, especially in the cure of painter's colic; in large doses they are violently
emetic. It is a native of South America.</p>

<p>21. <span class="smcap">Aloe socotrina.</span>&mdash;Bitter aloe, a plant of the lily family, which furnishes the
finest aloes. The bitter, resinous juice is stored up in greenish vessels, lying
beneath the skin of the leaf, so that when the leaves are cut transversely, the
juice exudes, and is gradually evaporated to a firm consistence. The inferior
kinds of aloes are prepared by pressing the leaves, when the resinous juice
becomes mixed with the mucilaginous fluid from the central part of the leaves,
and thus it is proportionately deteriorated. Sometimes the leaves are cut and
boiled, and the decoction evaporated to a proper consistence. This drug is
imported in chests, in skins of animals, and sometimes in large calabash-gourds,
and although the taste is peculiarly bitter and disagreeable, the perfume
of the finer sorts is aromatic, and by no means offensive. It is common
in tropical countries.</p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap">Alsophila australis.</span>&mdash;This beautiful tree-fern attains a height of stem of 25
to 30 feet, with fronds spreading out into a crest 26 feet in diameter. These
plants are among the most beautiful of all vegetable productions, and in their
gigantic forms indicate, in a meager degree, the extraordinary beauty of the
vegetation on the globe previous to the formation of the coal measures.</p>

<p>23. <span class="smcap">Alstonia scholaris.</span>&mdash;The Pali-mara, or devil tree, of Bombay. The plant
attains a height of 80 or 90 feet; the bark is powerfully bitter, and is used in
India in medicine. It is of the family of <i>Apocynace&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>24. <span class="smcap">Amomum melegueta.</span>&mdash;Malaguetta pepper, or grains of paradise; belonging
to the ginger family, <i>Zingiberace&aelig;</i>. The seeds of this and other species are
imported from Guinea; they have a very warm and camphor-like taste, and
are used to give a fictitious strength to adulterated liquors, but are not considered
particularly injurious to health. The seeds are aromatic and stimulating,
and form, with other seeds of similar plants, what are known as cardamoms.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap">Amyris balsamifera.</span>&mdash;This plant yields the wood called Lignum Rhodium.
It also furnishes a gum resin analogous to Elemi, and supposed to yield Indian
Bdellium.</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap">Anacardium occidentale.</span>&mdash;The cashew nut tree, cultivated in the West Indies
and other tropical countries. The stem furnishes a milky juice, which becomes
hard and black when dry, and is used as a varnish. It also secretes
a gum, like gum arabic. The nut or fruit contains a black, acrid, caustic oil,
injurious to the lips and tongue of those who attempt to crack the nut with
their teeth; it becomes innocuous and wholesome when roasted, but this
process must be carefully conducted, the acridity of the fumes producing
severe inflammation of the face if approached too near.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>27. <span class="smcap">Ananassa sativa.</span>&mdash;The well-known pineapple, the fruit of which was described
three hundred years ago, by Jean de L&eacute;ry, a Huguenot priest, as being
of such excellence that the gods might luxuriate upon it, and that it should
only be gathered by the hand of a Venus. It is supposed to be a native of
Brazil, and to have been carried from thence to the West, and afterwards to
the East Indies. It first became known to Europeans in Peru. It is universally
acknowledged to be one of the most delicious fruits in the world. Like
all other fruits that have been a long time under cultivation, there are numerous
varieties that vary greatly, both in quality and appearance. The leaves
yield a fine fiber, which is used in the manufacture of pina cloth; this cloth
is very delicate, soft, and transparent, and is made into shawls, scarfs, handkerchiefs,
and dresses.</p>

<p>28. <span class="smcap">Andira inermis.</span>&mdash;This is a native of Senegambia. Its bark is anthelmintic,
but requires care in its administration, being powerfully narcotic. It has a
sweetish taste, but a disagreeable smell, and is generally given in the form of
a decoction, which is made by boiling an ounce of the dried bark in a quart
of water until it assumes the color of Madeira wine. Three or four grains of
the powdered bark acts as a powerful purgative. The bark is known as
bastard cabbage bark, or worm bark. It is almost obsolete in medicine.</p>

<p>29. <span class="smcap">Andropogon muricatus.</span>&mdash;The Khus-Khus, or Vetiver grass of India. The
fibrous roots yield a most peculiar but pleasing perfume. In India the leaves
are manufactured into awnings, blinds, and sunshades; but principally for
screens, used in hot weather for doors and windows, which, when wetted,
diffuse a peculiar and refreshing perfume, while cooling the air.</p>

<p>30. <span class="smcap">Andropogon sch&#339;nanthus.</span>&mdash;The sweet-scented lemon grass, a native of
Malabar. An essential oil is distilled from the leaves, which is used in perfumery.
It is a favorite herb with the Asiatics, both for medicinal and culinary
purposes. Tea from the dried leaves is a favorite beverage of some
persons.</p>

<p>31. <span class="smcap">Anona cherimolia.</span>&mdash;The Cherimoyer of Peru, where it is extensively cultivated
for its fruits, which are highly esteemed by the inhabitants, but not so highly
valued by those accustomed to the fruits of temperate climates. The fruit,
when ripe, is of a pale greenish-yellow color, tinged with purple, weighing
from 3 to 4 pounds; the skin thin; the flesh sweet, and about the consistence
of a custard; hence often called custard apple.</p>

<p>32. <span class="smcap">Anona muricata.</span>&mdash;The sour-sop, a native of the West Indies, which produces
a fruit of considerable size, often weighing over 2 pounds. The pulp is
white and has an acrid flavor, which is not disagreeable.</p>

<p>33. <span class="smcap">Anona reticulata.</span>&mdash;The common custard apple of the West Indies. It has a yellowish
pulp and is not so highly esteemed as an article of food as some others
of the species. It bears the name of Condissa in Brazil. The Anonas are
grown to some extent throughout southern Florida.</p>

<p>34. <span class="smcap">Anona squamosa.</span>&mdash;The sweet-sop, a native of the Malay Islands, where it is
grown for its fruits. These are ovate in shape, with a thick rind, which incloses
a luscious pulp. The seeds contain an acrid principle, and, being reduced
to powder, form an ingredient for the destruction of insects.</p>

<p>35. <span class="smcap">Antiaris innoxia.</span>&mdash;The upas tree. Most exaggerated statements respecting
this plant have passed into history. Its poisonous influence was said to be so
great as not only to destroy all animal life but even plants could not live
within 10 miles of it. The plant has no such virulent properties as the above,
but, as it inhabits low valleys in Java where carbonic acid gas escapes from
the crevices in volcanic rocks which frequently proves fatal to animals, the
tree was blamed wrongly. It is, however, possessed of poisonous juice, which,
when dry and mixed with other ingredients, forms a venomous poison for
arrows, and severe effects have been felt by those who have climbed upon
the branches for the purpose of gathering the flowers.</p>

<p>36. <span class="smcap">Antiaris saccidora.</span>&mdash;The sack tree; so called from the fibrous bark being
used as sacks. For this purpose young trees of about a foot in diameter are
selected and cut into junks of the same length as the sack required. The
outer bark is then removed and the inner bark loosened by pounding, so that
it can be separated by turning it inside out. Sometimes a small piece of the
wood is left to form the bottom of the sack. The fruit exudes a milky,
viscid juice, which hardens into the consistency of beeswax, but becomes
black and shining.</p>

<p>37. <span class="smcap">Antidesma bunias.</span>&mdash;An East India plant which produces small, intensely
black fruit about the size of a currant, used in making preserves. The bark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
furnishes a good fiber, which is utilized in the manufacture of ropes. A
decoction of the leaves is a reputed cure for snake bites. The whole plant
is very bitter.</p>

<p>38. <span class="smcap">Aralia papyrifera.</span>&mdash;The Chinese rice paper plant. The stems are filled with
pith of very fine texture and white as snow, from which is derived the article
known as rice paper, much used in preparing artificial flowers.</p>

<p>39. <span class="smcap">Araucaria bidwillii.</span>&mdash;The Bunya-Bunya of Australia, which forms a large tree,
reaching from 150 to 200 feet in height. The cones are very large, and contain
one hundred to one hundred and fifty seeds, which are highly prized
by the aborigines as food. They are best when roasted in the shell, cracked
between two stones and eaten while hot. In flavor they resemble roasted
chestnuts. During the season of the ripening of these seeds the natives grow
sleek and fat. That part of the country where these trees most abound is
called the Bunya-Bunya country.</p>

<p>40. <span class="smcap">Araucaria brasiliensis.</span>&mdash;The Brazilian Araucaria, which grows at great elevations.
The seeds of this tree are commonly sold in the markets of Rio
Janeiro as an article of food. The resinous matter which exudes from the
trunk is employed in the manufacture of candles.</p>

<p>41. <span class="smcap">Araucaria cunninghamii.</span>&mdash;The Morton Bay pine. This Australian tree forms
a very straight trunk, and yields a timber of much commercial importance
in Sidney and other ports. It is chiefly used for house building and some of
the heavier articles of furniture.</p>

<p>42. <span class="smcap">Araucaria excelsa.</span>&mdash;This very elegant evergreen is a native of Norfolk
Island. Few plants can compare with it in beauty and regularity of growth.
The wood is of no particular value, although used for building purposes in
Norfolk Island.</p>

<p>43. <span class="smcap">Ardisia crenata.</span>&mdash;A native of China. The bark has tonic and astringent
properties, and is used in fevers and for external application in the cure of
ulcers, etc.</p>

<p>44. <span class="smcap">Areca catechu.</span>&mdash;This palm is cultivated in all the warmer parts of Asia for
its seed. This is known under the name of betel nut, and is about the size of
a nutmeg. The chewing of these nuts is a common practice of hundreds of
thousands of people. The nut is cut into small pieces, mixed with a small
quantity of lime, and rolled up in leaves of the betel pepper. The pellet is
chewed, and is hot and acrid, but possesses aromatic and astringent properties.
It tinges the saliva red and stains the teeth. The practice is considered
beneficial rather than otherwise, just as chewing tobacco-leaves, drinking alcohol,
and eating chicken-salad are considered healthful practices in some
portions of the globe. A kind of catechu is obtained by boiling down the
seeds to the consistence of an extract, but the chief supply of this drug is Acacia
catechu.</p>

<p>45. <span class="smcap">Argania sideroxylon.</span>&mdash;This is the argan tree of Morocco. It is remarkable
for its low-spreading mode of growth. Trees have been measured only 16
feet in height, while the circumference of the branches was 220 feet. The
fruit is much eaten and relished by cattle. The wood is hard and so heavy as
to sink in water. A valuable oil is extracted from the seeds.</p>

<p>46. <span class="smcap">Aristolochia grandiflora.</span>&mdash;The pelican flower. This plant belongs to a family
famed for the curious construction of their flowers, as well as for their
medical qualities. In tropical America various species receive the name of
"Guaco," which is a term given to plants that are used in the cure of snake
bites. Even some of our native species, such as <i>A. serpentaria</i>, is known as
snake-root, and is said to be esteemed for curing the bite of the rattlesnake.
It is stated that the Egyptian jugglers use some of these plants to stupefy the
snakes before they handle them. <i>A. bracteata</i> and <i>A. indica</i> are used for
similar purposes in India. It is said that the juice of the root of <i>A. anguicida</i>,
if introduced into the mouth of a serpent, so stupefies it that it may be handled
with impunity. The Indians, after having "guaconized" themselves,
that is, having taken Guaco, handle the most venomous snakes without injury.</p>

<p>47. <span class="smcap">Artanthe elongata.</span>&mdash;A plant of the pepper family, which furnishes one of
the articles known by the Peruvians as Matico, and which is used by them
for the same purposes as cubebs; but its chief value is as a styptic, an effect
probably produced by its rough under surface, acting mechanically like lint.
It has been employed internally to check hemorrhages, but with doubtful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
effect. Its aromatic bitter stimulant properties are like those of cubebs, and
depend on a volatile oil, a dark-green resin, and a peculiar bitter principle
called <i>maticin</i>.</p>

<p>48. <span class="smcap">Artocarpus incisa.</span>&mdash;This is the breadfruit tree of the South Sea Islands,
where its introduction gave occasion for the historical incidents arising from
the mutiny of the "Bounty." The round fruits contain a white pulp, of the
consistence of new bread. It is roasted before being eaten, but has little
flavor. The tree furnishes a viscid juice containing caoutchouc, which is
used as glue for calking canoes. In the South Sea Islands the breadfruit
constitutes the principal article of diet; it is prepared by baking in an oven
heated by hot stones.</p>

<p>49. <span class="smcap">Artocarpus integrifolia.</span>&mdash;The jack of the Indian Archipelago, cultivated
for its fruit, which is a favorite article among the natives, as also are the
roasted seeds. The wood is much used, and resembles mahogany. Bird-lime
is made from the juice.</p>

<p>50. <span class="smcap">Astrocaryum vulgare.</span>&mdash;Every part of this South American palm is covered
with sharp spines. It is cultivated to some extent by the Indians of Brazil for
the sake of its young leaves, which furnish a strong fiber for making bowstrings,
fishing nets, etc. The finer threads are knitted into hammocks, which
are of great strength. It is known as Tucum thread. The pulp of the fruit
furnishes an oil. In Guiana it is called the Aoura palm.</p>

<p>51. <span class="smcap">Attalea cohune.</span>&mdash;This palm furnishes Cahoun nuts, from which is extracted
cohune oil, used as a burning oil, for which purpose it is superior to cocoanut
oil. Piassaba fiber is furnished by this and <i>A. funifera</i>, the seeds of which
are known as Coquilla nuts; these nuts are 3 or 4 inches long, oval, of a rich
brown color, and very hard; they are much used by turners for making the
handles of doors, umbrellas, etc. The fiber derived from the decaying of the
cellular matter at the base of the leaf-stalks is much used in Brazil for making
ropes. It is largely used in England and other places for making coarse brooms,
chiefly used in cleaning streets.</p>

<p>52. <span class="smcap">Averrhoa bilimbi.</span>&mdash;This is called the blimbing, and is cultivated to some
extent in the East Indies. The fruit is oblong, obtuse-angled, somewhat resembling
a short, thick cucumber, with a thin, smooth, green rind, filled with
a pleasant, acid juice.</p>

<p>53. <span class="smcap">Averrhoa carambola.</span>&mdash;The caramba of Ceylon and Bengal. The fruit of this
tree is about the size of a large orange, and, when ripe, is of a rich yellow
color, with a very decided and agreeable fragrance. The pulp contains a large
portion of acid, and is generally used as a pickle or preserve. In Java it is
used both in the ripe and unripe state in pies; a sirup is also made of the
juice, and a conserve of the flowers. These preparations are highly valued as
remedies in fevers and bilious disorders.</p>

<p>54. <span class="smcap">Bactris major.</span>&mdash;The Marajah palm, of Brazil, which grows upon the banks of
the Amazon River. It has a succulent, rather acid fruit, from which a vinous
beverage is prepared. <i>B. minor</i> has a stem about 14 feet high and about an
inch in diameter. These stems are used for walking canes, and are sometimes
called Tobago canes.</p>

<p>55. <span class="smcap">Balsamocarpon brevifolium.</span>&mdash;This shrub is the algarrobo of the Chilians.
It belongs to the pea family. Its pods are short and thick, and when unripe
contain about 80 per cent of tannic acid; the ripe pods become transformed
into a cracked resinous substance, when their tanning value is much impaired;
this resinous matter is astringent, and is used for dyeing black and for making
ink.</p>

<p>56. <span class="smcap">Balsamodendron myrrha.</span>&mdash;A native of Arabia Felix, producing a gum resin,
sometimes called Opobalsamum, which was considered by the ancients as a
panacea for almost all the ills that flesh is heir to. <i>B. mukul</i> yields a resin
of this name, and is considered identical with the Bdellium of Dioscorides and
of the Scriptures. The resin has cordial and stimulating properties, and is
burnt as an incense. In ancient times it was used as an embalming ingredient.</p>

<p>57. <span class="smcap">Bambusa arundinacea.</span>&mdash;The bamboo cane, a gigantic grass, cultivated in many
tropical and semitropical countries. The Chinese use it in one way or other
for nearly everything they require. Almost every article of furniture in their
houses, including mats, screens, chairs, tables, bedsteads, and bedding, is made
of bamboo. The masts, sails, and rigging of their ships consist chiefly
of bamboo. A fiber has been obtained from the stem suitable for mixing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
with wool, cotton, and silk; it is said to be very soft and to take dyes easily.
They have treatises and volumes on its culture, showing the best soil and the
seasons for planting and transplanting this useful production.</p>

<p>58. <span class="smcap">Bauhinia vahlii.</span>&mdash;The Maloo-climber of India, where the gigantic shrubby
stems often attain a height of 300 feet, running over the tops of the tallest
trees, and twisting so tightly around their stems as to kill them. The exceedingly
tough fibrous bark of this plant is used in India for making ropes and
in the construction of suspension bridges. The seeds form an article of food;
they are eaten raw, and resemble cashew nuts in flavor.</p>

<p>59. <span class="smcap">Beaucarnea recurvifolia.</span>&mdash;This Mexican plant is remarkable for the large
bulbiform swelling at the base of the stem. It is a plant of much elegance
and beauty, resembling a drooping fountain.</p>

<p>60. <span class="smcap">Bergera koenigii.</span>&mdash;The curry-leaf tree of India. The fragrant, aromatic leaves
are used to flavor curries. The leaves, root, and bark are used medicinally.
The wood is hard and durable, and from the seeds a clear, transparent oil,
called Simbolee oil, is extracted.</p>

<p>61. <span class="smcap">Berrya ammonilla.</span>&mdash;This furnishes the Trincomalee wood of the Philippine
Islands and Ceylon, and is largely used for making oil casks and for building
boats, for which it is well adapted, being light and strong.</p>

<p>62. <span class="smcap">Bertholletia excelsa.</span>&mdash;This furnishes the well known Brazil nuts, or cream
nuts of commerce. The tree is a native of South America and attains a
height of 100 to 150 feet. The fruit is nearly round and contains from eighteen
to twenty-four seeds, which are so beautifully packed in the shell that
when once removed it is found impossible to replace them. A bland oil is
pressed from the seeds, which is used by artists, and at Para the fibrous bark
of the tree is used for calking ships, as a substitute for oakum.</p>

<p>63. <span class="smcap">Bignonia echinata.</span>&mdash;A native of Mexico, where it is sometimes called Mariposa
butterfly. The branches are said to be used in the adulteration of sarsaparilla.
<i>B. chica</i>, a native of Venezuela, furnishes a red pigment, obtained
by macerating the leaves in water, which is used by the natives for painting
their bodies. The long flexible stems of <i>B. kerere</i> furnish the natives of French
Guiana with a substitute for ropes. <i>B. alliacea</i> is termed the Garlic shrub,
because of the powerful odor of garlic emitted from its leaves and branches
when bruised. These plants all have showy flowers, and the genus is represented
with us by such beautiful flowers as are produced by <i>B. radicans</i> and
<i>B. capreolata</i>.</p>

<p>64. <span class="smcap">Bixa orellana.</span>&mdash;Arnotta plant. This plant is a native of South America, but
has been introduced and cultivated both in the West and East Indies. It
bears bunches of pink-colored flowers, which are followed by oblong bristled
pods. The seeds are thinly coated with red, waxy pulp, which is separated
by stirring them in water until it is detached, when it is strained off and evaporated
to the consistence of putty, when it is made up into rolls; in this condition
it is known as flag or roll arnotta, but when thoroughly dried it is
made into cakes and sold as cake arnotta. It is much used by the South
American Caribs and other tribes of Indians for painting their bodies, paint
being almost their only article of clothing. As a commercial article it is
mainly used as a coloring for cheese, butter, and inferior chocolates, to all of
which it gives the required tinge without imparting any unpleasant flavor
or unwholesome quality. It is also used in imparting rich orange and gold-colored
tints to various kinds of varnishes.</p>

<p>65. <span class="smcap">Blighia sapida.</span>&mdash;The akee fruit of Guinea. The fruit is about 3 inches long
by 2 inches wide; the seeds are surrounded by a spongy substance, which is
eaten. It has a subacid, agreeable taste. A small quantity of semisolid
fatty oil is obtained from the seeds by pressure.</p>

<p>66. <span class="smcap">B&#339;hmeria nivea.</span>&mdash;A plant of the nettle family, which yields the fiber known
as Chinese grass. The beautiful fabric called grasscloth, which rivals the best
French cambric in softness and fineness of texture, is manufactured from
the fiber of this plant. The fiber is also variously known in commerce as
rheea, ramie, and in China as Tchow-ma. It is a plant of the easiest culture,
and has been introduced into the Southern States, where it grows
freely. When once machinery is perfected so as to enable its being cheaply
prepared for the manufacturer, a great demand will arise for this fiber.</p>

<p>67. <span class="smcap">Boldoa fragrans.</span>&mdash;A Chilian plant which yields small edible fruits; these, as
well as all parts of the plant, are very aromatic. The bark is used for tanning,
and the wood is highly esteemed for making charcoal. An alkaloid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
called <i>boldine</i>, extracted from the plant, has reputed medicinal value, and a
drug called Boldu is similarly produced.</p>

<p>68. <span class="smcap">Borassus flabelliformis.</span>&mdash;The Palmyra palm. The parts of this tree are
applied to such a multitude of purposes that a poem in the Tamil language,
although enumerating eight hundred uses, does not exhaust the catalogue.
In old trees the wood becomes hard and is very durable. The leaves are
from 8 to 10 feet long, and are used for thatching houses, making various
mattings, bags, etc. They also supply the Hindoo with paper, upon which
he writes with a stylus. A most important product called toddy or palm
wine is obtained from the flower spikes, which yield a great quantity of
juice for four or five months. Palm-toddy is intoxicating, and when distilled
yields strong arrack. Very good vinegar is also obtained from it, and
large quantities of jaggery or palm sugar are manufactured from the toddy.
The fruits are large and have a thick coating of fibrous pulp, which is cooked
and eaten or made into jelly. The young palm plants are cultivated for the
market, as cabbages are with us, and eaten, either when fresh or after being
dried in the sun.</p>

<p>69. <span class="smcap">Boswellia thurifera.</span>&mdash;This Coromandel tree furnishes the resin known as
olibanum, which is supposed to have been the frankincense of the ancients.
It is sometimes used in medicine as an astringent and stimulant, and is employed,
because of its grateful perfume, as an incense in churches.</p>

<p>70. <span class="smcap">Bromelia karatas.</span>&mdash;The Corawa fiber, or silk-grass of Guiana, is obtained
from this plant, which is very strong, and much used for bowstrings, fishing
lines, nets, and ropes.</p>

<p>71. <span class="smcap">Bromelia pinguin.</span>&mdash;This is very common as a hedge or fence plant in the
West Indies. The leaves, when beaten with a blunt mallet and macerated in
water, produce fibers from which beautiful fabrics are manufactured. The
fruit yields a cooling juice much used in fevers.</p>

<p>72. <span class="smcap">Brosimum alicastrum.</span>&mdash;The bread-nut tree of Jamaica. The nuts or seeds
produced by this tree are said to form an agreeable and nutritious article of
food. When cooked they taste like hazelnuts. The young branches and
shoots are greedily eaten by horses and cattle, and the wood resembles mahogany,
and is used for making furniture.</p>

<p>73. <span class="smcap">Brosimum galactodendron.</span>&mdash;The cow tree of South America, which yields a
milk of as good quality as that from the cow. It forms large forests on the
mountains near the town of Cariaco and elsewhere along the seacoast of
Venezuela, reaching to a considerable height. In South America the cow
tree is called Palo de Vaca, or Arbol de Leche. Its milk, which is obtained by
making incisions in the trunk, so closely resembles the milk of the cow, both
in appearance and quality, that it is commonly used as an article of food by
the inhabitants of the places where the tree is abundant. Unlike many other
vegetable milks, it is perfectly wholesome, and very nourishing, possessing an
agreeable taste, and a pleasant balsamic odor, its only unpleasant quality being
a slight amount of stickiness. The chemical analysis of this milk has
shown it to possess a composition closely resembling some animal substances;
and, like animal milk, it quickly forms a cheesy scum, and after a few days'
exposure to the atmosphere, turns sour and putrefies. It contains upwards
of 30 per cent of a resinous substance called <i>galactine</i>.</p>

<p>74. <span class="smcap">Brya ebenus.</span>&mdash;Jamaica or West India ebony tree. This is not the plant that
yields the true ebony-wood of commerce. Jamaica ebony is of a greenish-brown
color, very hard, and so heavy that it sinks in water. It takes a good
polish, and is used by turners for the manufacture of numerous kinds of
small wares.</p>

<p>75. <span class="smcap">Byrsonima spicata.</span>&mdash;A Brazilian plant, furnishing an astringent bark used
for tanning, and also containing a red coloring matter employed in dyeing.
The berries are used in medicine, and a decoction of the roots is used for
ulcers.</p>

<p>76. <span class="smcap">C&aelig;salpinia bonduc.</span>&mdash;A tropical plant, bearing the seeds known as nicker nuts,
or bonduc nuts. These are often strung together for necklaces. The kernels
have a very bitter taste, and the oil obtained from them is used medicinally.</p>

<p>77. <span class="smcap">C&aelig;salpinia pulcherrima.</span>&mdash;This beautiful flowering leguminous plant is a native
of the East Indies, but is cultivated in all the tropics. In Jamaica it is
called the "Barbados flower." The wood is sought after for charcoal, and a
decoction of the leaves and flowers is used in fevers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>78. <span class="smcap">C&aelig;salpinia sappan.</span>&mdash;The brownish-red wood of this Indian tree furnishes the
Sappan wood of commerce, from which dyers obtain a red color, principally
used for dyeing cotton goods. Its root also affords an orange-yellow dye.</p>

<p>79. <span class="smcap">Calamus rotang.</span>&mdash;This is one of the palms that furnish the canes or rattans
used for chair bottoms, sides of pony-carriages, and similar purposes. It is a
climbing palm and grows to an immense length; specimens 300 feet long have
been exhibited, climbing over and amongst the branches of trees, supporting
themselves by means of the hooked spines attached to the leaf stalks. <i>C. rudentum</i>
and <i>C. viminalis</i> furnish flexible canes. In their native countries
they are used for a variety of manufacturing purposes, also for ropes and
cables used by junks and other coasting vessels. In the Himalayas they are
used in the formation of suspension bridges across rivers and deep ravines. <i>C.
scipionum</i> furnishes the well-known Malacca canes used for walking sticks.
They are naturally of a rich brown color. The clouded and mottled appearance
which some of these present is said to be imparted to them by smoking
and steaming.</p>

<p>80. <span class="smcap">Callistemon salignus.</span>&mdash;A medium-sized tree from Australia; one of the many
so-called tea trees of that country. The wood, which is very hard, is known
as stone wood and has been used for wood engraving. Layers of the bark
readily peel off; hence it also receives the name of paper-bark plant.</p>

<p>81. <span class="smcap">Callitris quadrivalvis.</span>&mdash;This coniferous plant is a native of Barbary. It
yields a hard, durable, and fragrant timber, and is much employed in the
erection of mosques, etc., by the Africans of the North. The resin that exudes
from the tree is used in varnish under the name of gum-sandarach. In
powder it forms a principal ingredient of the article known as pounce.</p>

<p>82. <span class="smcap">Calophyllum calaba.</span>&mdash;This is called calaba tree in the West Indies, and an
oil, fit for burning, is expressed from the seeds. In the West Indies these
seeds are called Santa Maria nuts.</p>

<p>83. <span class="smcap">Calotropis gigantea.</span>&mdash;The inner bark of this plant yields a valuable fiber,
capable of bearing a greater strain than hemp. All parts of it abound in a
very acrid milky juice, which hardens into a substance resembling gutta-percha;
but in its fresh state it is a valuable remedy in cutaneous diseases.
The bark of the root also possesses similar medical qualities; and its tincture
yields <i>mudarine</i>, a substance that has the property of gelatinizing when
heated, and returning to the fluid state when cool. Paper has been made
from the silky down of the seeds.</p>

<p>84. <span class="smcap">Camellia japonica.</span>&mdash;A well-known green-house plant, cultivated for its large
double flowers. The seeds furnish an oil of an agreeable odor, which is used
for many domestic purposes.</p>

<p>85. <span class="smcap">Camphora officinarum.</span>&mdash;This tree belongs to the <i>Laurace&aelig;</i>. Camphor is
prepared from the wood by boiling chopped branches in water, when, after
some time, the camphor becomes deposited and is purified by sublimation.
It is mainly produced in the island of Formosa. The wood of the tree is
highly prized for manufacturing entomological cabinets. As the plant grows
well over a large area in the more Southern States, it is expected that the
preparation of its products will become a profitable industry.</p>

<p>86. <span class="smcap">Canella alba.</span>&mdash;This is a native of the West Indies, and furnishes a pale
olive-colored bark with an aromatic odor, and is used as a tonic. It is used
by the natives as a spice. It furnishes the true canella bark of commerce,
also known as white-wood bark.</p>

<p>87. <span class="smcap">Capparis spinosa.</span>&mdash;The caper plant, a native of the South of Europe and of
the Mediterranean regions. The commercial product consists of the flower-buds,
and sometimes the unripe fruits, pickled in vinegar. The wood and
bark possess acrid qualities which will act as a blister when applied to the
skin.</p>

<p>88. <span class="smcap">Carapa guianensis.</span>&mdash;A meliaceous plant, native of tropical America, where it
grows to a height of 60 to 80 feet. The bark of this tree possesses febrifugal
properties and is also used for tanning. By pressure, the seeds yield a liquid
oil called carap-oil or crab-oil, suitable for burning in lamps.</p>

<p>89. <span class="smcap">Carica papaya.</span>&mdash;This is the South American papaw tree, but is cultivated in
most tropical countries. It is also known as the melon-apple. The fruit is
of a dingy orange-color, of an oblong form, about 8 to 10 inches long, by 3 or
4 inches broad. It is said that the juice of the tree, or an infusion of the
leaves and fruit, has the property of rendering tough fiber quite tender.
Animals fed upon the fruit and leaves will have very tender and juicy flesh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>90. <span class="smcap">Carludovica palmata.</span>&mdash;A pandanaceous plant from Panama and southward.
Panama hats are made from the leaves of this plant. The leaves are cut when
young, and the stiff parallel veins removed, after which they are slit into
shreds, but not separated at the stalk end, and immersed in boiling water for
a short time, then bleached in the sun.</p>

<p>91. <span class="smcap">Caryocar nuciferum.</span>&mdash;On the river banks of Guiana this grows to a large-sized
tree. It yields the butter-nuts, or souari-nuts of commerce. These are of a
flattened kidney shape, with a hard woody shell of a reddish-brown color, and
covered with wart-like protuberances. The nuts are pleasant to eat, and yield,
by expression, an oil called Piquia oil, which possesses the flavor of the fruit.</p>

<p>92. <span class="smcap">Caryophyllus aromaticus.</span>&mdash;This myrtaceous plant produces the well-known
spice called cloves. It forms a beautiful evergreen, rising from 20 to 30 feet
in height. The cloves of commerce are the unexpanded flower-buds; they
are collected by beating the tree with rods, when the buds, from the jointed
character of their stalks, readily fall, and are received on sheets spread on
purpose; they are then dried in the sun. All parts of the plant are aromatic,
from the presence of a volatile oil. The oil is sometimes used in toothache
and as a carminative in medicine.</p>

<p>93. <span class="smcap">Caryota urens.</span>&mdash;This fine palm is a native of Ceylon, and is also found in other
parts of India, where it supplies the native population with various important
articles. Large quantities of toddy, or palm-wine, are prepared from
the juice, which, when boiled, yields very good palm sugar or jaggery, and
also excellent sugar candy. Sago is also prepared from the central or pithy
part of the trunk, and forms a large portion of the food of the natives. The
fiber from the leaf stalk is of great strength; it is known as Kittool fiber,
and is used for making ropes, brushes, brooms, etc. A woolly kind of scurf,
scraped off the leaf stalks, is used for calking boats, and the stem furnishes
a small quantity of wood.</p>

<p>94. <span class="smcap">Casimiroa edulis.</span>&mdash;A Mexican plant, belonging to the orange family, with a
fruit about the size of an ordinary orange, which has an agreeable taste, but
is not considered to be wholesome. The seeds are poisonous; the bark is bitter,
and is sometimes used medicinally.</p>

<p>95. <span class="smcap">Cassia acutifolia.</span>&mdash;The cassias belong to the leguminous family. The leaflets
of this and some other species produce the well-known drug called senna.
That known as Alexandria senna is produced by the above. East Indian
senna is produced by <i>C. elongata</i>. Aleppo senna is obtained from <i>C. obovata</i>.
The native species, <i>C. marylandica</i>, possesses similar properties. The seeds
of <i>C. absus</i>, a native of Egypt, are bitter, aromatic, and mucilaginous, and
are used as a remedy for ophthalmia. <i>C. fistula</i> is called the Pudding-Pipe
tree, and furnishes the cassia pods of commerce. The seeds of <i>C. occidentalis</i>,
when roasted, are used as a substitute for coffee in the Mauritius and in the
interior of Africa.</p>

<p>96. <span class="smcap">Castilloa elastica.</span>&mdash;This is a Mexican tree, which yields a milky juice, forming
caoutchouc, but is not collected for commerce except in a limited way.</p>

<p>97. <span class="smcap">Casuarina quadrivalvis.</span>&mdash;This Tasmanian tree produces a very hard wood of
a reddish color, often called Beef wood. It is marked with dark stripes, and
is much used in some places for picture frames and cabinetwork. This belongs
to a curious family of trees having no leaves, but looking like a gigantic
specimen of Horse-tail grass, a weed to be seen in wet places.</p>

<p>98. <span class="smcap">Catha edulis.</span>&mdash;This plant is a native of Arabia, where it attains the height of
7 to 10 feet. Its leaves are used by the Arabs in preparing a beverage like tea
or coffee. The twigs, with leaves attached, in bundles of fifty, and in pieces
from 12 to 15 inches in length, form a very considerable article of commerce,
its use in Arabia corresponding to that of the Paraguay tea in South America
and the Chinese tea in Europe. The effects produced by a decoction of the
leaves of Cafta, as they are termed, are described as similar to those produced
by strong green tea, only more pleasing and agreeable. The Arab soldiers chew
the leaves when on sentry duty to keep them from feeling drowsy. Its use is of
great antiquity, preceding that of coffee. Its stimulating effects induced some
Arabs to class it with intoxicating substances, the use of which is forbidden
by the Koran, but a synod of learned Mussulmans decreed that, as it did not
impair the health or impede the observance of religious duties, but only increased
hilarity and good humor, it was lawful to use it.</p>

<p>99. <span class="smcap">Cecropia peltata.</span>&mdash;The South American trumpet tree, so called because its
hollow branches are used for musical instruments. The Waupe Indians form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a kind of drum by removing the pith or center of the branches. The inner
bark of the young branches yields a very tough fiber, which is made into
ropes. The milky juice of the stem hardens into caoutchouc.</p>

<p>100. <span class="smcap">Cedrela odorata.</span>&mdash;This forms a large tree in the West India Islands, and is
hollowed out for canoes; the wood is of a brown color and has a fragrant
odor, and is sometimes imported under the name of Jamaica cedar.</p>

<p>101. <span class="smcap">Ceph&aelig;lis ipecacuanha.</span>&mdash;This Brazilian plant produces the true ipecacuanha,
and belongs to the <i>Cinchonace&aelig;</i>. The root is the part used in medicine, it
is knotty, contorted, and annulated, and of a grayish-brown color, and its
emetic properties are due to a chemical principle called <i>emetin</i>.</p>

<p>102. <span class="smcap">Ceratonia siliqua.</span>&mdash;The carob bean. This leguminous plant is a native of
the countries bordering on the Mediterranean. The seed pods contain a
quantity of mucilaginous and saccharine matter, and are used as food for
cattle. Besides the name of carob beans, these pods are known as locust
pods, or St. John's bread, from a supposition that they formed the food of
St. John in the wilderness. It is now generally admitted that the locusts
of St. John were the insects so called, and which are still used as an article
of food in some of the Eastern countries. There is more reason for the
belief that the husks mentioned in the parable of the prodigal son were
these pods. The seeds were at one time used by singers, who imagined
that they softened and cleared the voice.</p>

<p>103. <span class="smcap">Cerbera thevetia.</span>&mdash;The name is intended to imply that the plant is as dangerous
as Cerberus. The plant has a milky, poisonous juice. The bark is
purgative; the unripe fruit is used by the natives of Travancore to destroy
dogs, as its action causes their teeth to loosen and fall out.</p>

<p>104. <span class="smcap">Cereus gigantea.</span>&mdash;The suwarrow of the Mexicans, a native of the hot,
arid, and almost desert regions of New Mexico, found growing in rocky
places, in valleys, and on mountain sides, often springing out of mere
crevices in hard rocks, and imparting a singular aspect to the scenery of
the country, its tall stems often reaching 40 feet in height, with upright
branches looking like telegraph posts for signaling from point to point of
the rocky mountains. The fruits are about 2 or 3 inches long, of a
green color and oval form; when ripe they burst into three or four pieces,
which curve back so as to resemble a flower. Inside they contain numerous
little black seeds, imbedded in a crimson-colored pulp, which the
Indians make into a preserve. They also eat the ripe fruit as an article of
food.</p>

<p>105. <span class="smcap">Cereus macdonaldi&aelig;.</span>&mdash;A night-blooming cereus, and one of the most beautiful.
The flowers when fully expanded are over a foot in diameter, having
numerous radiating red and bright orange sepals and delicately white
petals. It is a native of the Honduras.</p>

<p>106. <span class="smcap">Ceroxylon andicola.</span>&mdash;The wax palm of New Grenada, first described by
Humboldt and Bonpland, who found it on elevated mountains, extending
as high as the lower limit of perpetual snow. Its tall trunk is covered
with a thin coating of a whitish waxy substance, giving it a marbled
appearance. The waxy substance forms an article of commerce, and is
obtained by scraping the trunk. It consists of two parts of resin and one
wax, and, when mixed with one third of tallow, it makes very good
candles. The stem is used for building purposes, and the leaves for thatching
roofs.</p>

<p>107. <span class="smcap">Cham&aelig;dorea elegans.</span>&mdash;This belongs to a genus of palms native of South
America. The plant is of tall, slender growth; the stems are used for
walking canes, and the young, unexpanded flower spikes are used as a
vegetable.</p>

<p>108. <span class="smcap">Cham&aelig;rops fortunei.</span>&mdash;This palm is a native of the north of China, and is
nearly hardy here. In China, the coarse brown fibers obtained from the
leaves are used for making hats and also garments called So-e, worn in wet
weather.</p>

<p>109. <span class="smcap">Cham&aelig;rops humilis.</span>&mdash;This is the only European species of palm, and does
not extend farther north than Nice. The leaves are commonly used in the
south of Europe for making hats, brooms, baskets, etc. From the leaf fiber
a material resembling horse hair is prepared, and the Arabs mix it with
camel's hair for their tent covers.</p>

<p>110. <span class="smcap">Chavica betel.</span>&mdash;This plant is found all over the East Indies, where its leaf is
largely used by Indian natives as a masticatory. Its consumption is immense,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and has been said to equal that of tobacco by Western peoples.
It is prepared for chewing by inclosing in the leaves a slice of the areca
nut, and a small portion of lime. It is thought to act as a stimulant to the
digestive organs, but causes giddiness and other unpleasant symptoms to
those not accustomed to its use.</p>

<p>111. <span class="smcap">Chiococca racemosa.</span>&mdash;This plant is found in many warm countries, such as
in southern Florida. It is called cahinca in Brazil, where a preparation
of the bark of the root is employed as a remedy for snake bites. Almost
every locality where snakes exist has its local remedies for poisonous bites,
but they rarely prove to be efficient when truthfully and fairly tested.</p>

<p>112. <span class="smcap">Chloranthus officinalis.</span>&mdash;The roots of this plant are an aromatic stimulant,
much used as medicine in the Island of Java; also, when mixed with
anise, it has proved valuable in malignant smallpox.</p>

<p>113. <span class="smcap">Chloroxylon swietenia.</span>&mdash;The satinwood tree of tropical countries. It is
principally used for making the backs of clothes and hair brushes, and for
articles of turnery-ware; the finest mottled pieces are cut into veneers and
used for cabinet-making.</p>

<p>114. <span class="smcap">Chrysobalanus icaco.</span>&mdash;The cocoa plum of the West Indies. The fruits
are about the size of a plum, and are of various colors, white, yellow, red,
or purple. The pulp is sweet, a little austere, but not disagreeable. The
fruits are preserved and exported from Cuba and other West India Islands.
The kernels yield a fixed oil, and an emulsion made with them is used
medicinally.</p>

<p>115. <span class="smcap">Chrysophyllum cainito.</span>&mdash;The fruit of this plant is known in the West
Indies as the star apple, the interior of which, when cut across, shows ten
cells, and as many seeds disposed regularly round the center, giving a star-like
appearance, as stars are generally represented in the most reliable
almanacs. It receives its botanic name from the golden silky color on the
under side of the leaves.</p>

<p>116. <span class="smcap">Cicca disticha.</span>&mdash;This Indian plant is cultivated in many parts under the
name of Otaheite gooseberry. The fruits resemble those of a green gooseberry.
They have an acid flavor; are used for preserving or pickling, and
eaten either in a raw state or cooked in various ways.</p>

<p>117. <span class="smcap">Cinchona calisaya.</span>&mdash;The yellow bark of Bolivia. This is one of the so-called
Peruvian Bark trees. The discovery of the medicinal value of this bark is a
matter of fable and conjecture. The name cinchona is derived from that of
the wife of a viceroy of Peru, who is said to have taken the drug from South
America to Europe in 1639. Afterwards the Jesuits used it; hence it is
sometimes called Jesuit's bark. It was brought most particularly into
notice when Louis XIV of France purchased of Sir R. Talbor, an Englishman,
his heretofore secret remedy for intermittent fever, and made it public.</p></div>

<div class="block1"><p>There are various barks in commerce classified under the head of Peruvian
barks. Their great value depends upon the presence of certain alkaloid
substances called quinine, cinchonine, and quinidine, which exist in
the bark in combination with tannic and other acids. Quinine is the
most useful of these alkaloids, and this is found in greatest quantities
in Calisaya bark. The gray bark of Huanuco is derived from <i>Cinchona
micrantha</i>, which is characterized by its yield of cinchonine, and the Loxa
or Loja barks are furnished in part by <i>Cinchona officinalis</i>, and are especially
rich in quinidine. There is some uncertainty about the trees that
produce the various kinds of bark. These trees grow in the forests of
Bolivia and Peru, at various elevations on the mountains, but chiefly in
sheltered mountain valleys, and all of them at a considerable distance below
the frost or snow line. They are destroyed by the slightest frost. Plants of
various species have been distributed from time to time, in localities which
seemed most favorable to their growth, but all reports from these distributions
have, so far, been discouraging.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>118. <span class="smcap">Cinnamomum cassia.</span>&mdash;This furnishes cassia bark, which is much like cinnamon,
but thicker, coarser, stronger, less delicate in flavor, and cheaper;
hence it is often used to adulterate cinnamon. The unexpanded flower
buds are sold as cassia buds, possessing properties similar to those of the
bark. It is grown in southern China, Java, and tropical countries generally.</p>

<p>119. <span class="smcap">Cinnamomum zeylanicum.</span>&mdash;A tree belonging to <i>Laurace&aelig;</i>, which furnishes
the best cinnamon. It is prepared by stripping the bark from the branches,
when it rolls up into quills, the smaller of which are introduced into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
larger, and then dried in the sun. Cinnamon is much used as a condiment
for its pleasant flavor, and its astringent properties are of medicinal value.
It is cultivated largely in Ceylon. The cinnamon tree is too tender to become
of commercial importance in the United States. Isolated plants may
be found in southern Florida, at least it is so stated, but the area suited to
its growth must be very limited.</p>

<p>120. <span class="smcap">Cissampelos pareira.</span>&mdash;The velvet plant of tropical countries. The root furnishes
the <i>Pareira brava</i> of druggists, which is used in medicine.</p>

<p>121. <span class="smcap">Citrus aurantium.</span>&mdash;The orange, generally supposed to be a native of the
north of India. It was introduced into Arabia during the ninth century. It
was unknown in Europe in the eleventh century. Oranges were cultivated
at Seville towards the end of the twelfth century, and at Palermo in the
thirteenth. In the fourteenth century they were plentiful in several parts
of Italy. There are many varieties of the orange in cultivation. The blood
red, or Malta, is much esteemed; the fruit is round, reddish-yellow outside
and the pulp irregularly mottled with crimson. The Mandarin or Tangerine
orange has a thin rind which separates easily from the pulp, and is very
sweet and rich. The St. Michael's orange is one of the most productive and
delicious varieties, with a thin rind and very sweet pulp. The Seville or
bitter orange is used for the manufacture of bitter tincture and candied
orange-peel. The Bergamot orange has peculiarly fragrant flowers and
fruit, from each of which an essence of a delicious quality is extracted.</p>

<p>122. <span class="smcap">Citrus decumana.</span>&mdash;The shaddock, which has the largest fruit of the family.
It is a native of China and Japan, where it is known as sweet ball. The
pulp is acid or subacid, and in some varieties nearly sweet. From the thickness
of the skin the fruit will keep a considerable time without injury.</p>

<p>123. <span class="smcap">Citrus japonica.</span>&mdash;This is the Kum-quat of the Chinese. It forms a small
tree, or rather a large bush, and bears fruit about the size of a large cherry.
There are two forms, one bearing round fruits, the other long, oval fruits.
This fruit has a sweet rind and an agreeably acid pulp, and is usually eaten
whole without being peeled. It forms an excellent preserve, with sugar,
and is largely used in this form.</p>

<p>124. <span class="smcap">Citrus limetta.</span>&mdash;The lime, which is used for the same purposes as the lemon,
and by some preferred, the juice being considered more wholesome and the
acid more agreeable. There are several varieties, some of them being sweet
and quite insipid.</p>

<p>125. <span class="smcap">Citrus limonum.</span>&mdash;The lemon; this plant is found growing naturally in that
part of India which is beyond the Ganges. It was unknown to the ancient
Greeks and Romans. It is supposed to have been brought to Italy by the
Crusaders. Arabian writers of the twelfth century notice the lemon as
being cultivated in Egypt and other places. The varieties of the lemon are
very numerous and valued for their agreeable acid juice and essential oil.
They keep for a considerable time, especially if steeped for a short period
in salt water.</p>

<p>126. <span class="smcap">Citrus medica.</span>&mdash;The citron, found wild in the forests of northern India. The
Jews cultivated the citron at the time they were under subjection to the
Romans, and used the fruit in the Feast of the Tabernacles. There is no
proof of their having known the fruit in the time of Moses, but it is supposed
that they found it at Babylon, and brought it into Palestine. The citron
is cultivated in China and Cochin-China. It is easily naturalized and the
seeds are rapidly spread. In its wild state it grows erect; the branches are
spiny, the flowers purple on the outside and white on the inside. The fruit
furnishes the essential oil of citron and the essential oil of cedra. There are
several varieties; the fingered citron is a curious fruit, and the Madras citron
is very long and narrow; the skin is covered with protuberances.</p>

<p>127. <span class="smcap">Clusia rosea.</span>&mdash;A tropical plant which yields abundantly of a tenacious resin
from its stem, which is used for the same purpose as pitch. It is first of a
green color, but when exposed to the air it assumes a brown or reddish tint.
The Caribs use it for painting the bottoms of their boats.</p>

<p>128. <span class="smcap">Coccoloba uvifera.</span>&mdash;Known in the West Indies as the seaside grape, from
the peculiarity of the perianth, which becomes pulpy and of a violet color
and surrounds the ripe fruit. The pulpy perianth has an agreeable acid
flavor. An astringent extract is prepared from the plant which is used in
medicine.</p>

<p>129. <span class="smcap">Cocos nucifera.</span>&mdash;The cocoanut palm. This palm is cultivated throughout
the tropics so extensively that its native country is not known. One reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of its extensive dissemination is that it grows so close to the sea that the
ripe fruits are washed away by the waves and afterwards cast upon far-distant
shores, where they soon vegetate. It is in this way that the coral
islands of the Indian Ocean have become covered with these palms. Every
part of this tree is put to some useful purpose. The outside rind or husk
of the fruit yields the fiber from which the well-known cocoa matting is
manufactured. Cordage, clothes, brushes, brooms, and hats are made from
this fiber, and, when curled and dyed, it is used for stuffing mattresses and
cushions. An oil is produced by pressing the white kernel of the nut which
is used for cooking when fresh, and by pressure affords stearin, which is
made into candles, the liquid being used for lamps. The kernel is of great
importance as an article of food, and the milk affords an agreeable beverage.
While young it yields a delicious substance resembling blanc-mange. The
leaves are used for thatching, for making mats, baskets, hats, etc.; combs
are made from the hard footstalk; the heart of the tree is used as we use
cabbages. The brown fibrous net work from the base of the leaves is used
as sieves, and also made into garments. The wood is used for building and
for furniture. The flowers are used medicinally as an astringent and the
roots as a febrifuge.</p>

<p>130. <span class="smcap">Cocos plumosus.</span>&mdash;A Brazilian species, highly ornamental in its long, arching
leaves, and producing quantities of orange-colored nuts, in size about as large
as a chestnut, inclosed in an edible pulp.</p>

<p>131. <span class="smcap">Coffea arabica.</span>&mdash;The coffee plant, which belongs to the <i>Cinchonace&aelig;</i> and is a
native of Abyssinia, but is now cultivated in many tropical regions. It
can not be successfully cultivated in a climate where the temperature, at
any season of the year, falls below 55 degrees, although it will exist where
the temperature all but falls short of freezing, but a low fall of temperature
greatly retards the ripening of the fruit. Ripe fruits are often gathered
from plants in the extreme south of Florida. The beans or seeds are
roasted before use, and by this process they gain nearly one half in bulk
and lose about a fifth in weight. Heat also changes their essential qualities,
causing the development of the volatile oil and peculiar acid to which
the aroma and flavor are due. The berries contain theine; so also do the
leaves, and in some countries the latter are preferred.</p>

<p>132. <span class="smcap">Coffea liberica.</span>&mdash;The Liberian coffee, cultivated in Africa, of which country
it is a native. This plant is of larger and stronger growth than the Arabian
coffee plant and the fruit is larger. This species is of recent introduction
to commerce, and although it was reported as being more prolific than
the ordinary coffee plant, the statement has not been borne out in Brazil
and Mexico, where it has been tested. It is also more tender than the older
known species.</p>

<p>133. <span class="smcap">Cola acuminata.</span>&mdash;An African tree, which has been introduced into the West
Indies and Brazil for the sake of its seeds, which are known as Cola, or
Kola, or Goora nuts, and extensively used as a sort of condiment by the
natives of Africa. A small piece of one of these seeds is chewed before
each meal to promote digestion. It possesses properties similar to the leaves
of coca and contains theine. These nuts have from time immemorial occupied
a prominent place in the dietetic economy of native tribes in Africa,
and the demand for them has established a large commercial industry in
the regions where they are obtained.</p>

<p>134. <span class="smcap">Colocasia esculenta.</span>&mdash;This plant has been recommended for profitable culture
in this country for its edible root-stock. It is cultivated in the Sandwich
Islands under the name of Tara. The young leaves are cooked and
eaten in the same manner as spinach or greens in Egypt. They are acrid,
but lose their acridity when boiled, the water being changed. The roots are
filled with starch, and have long been used as food in various semitropical
countries.</p>

<p>135. <span class="smcap">Condaminea macrophylla.</span>&mdash;This plant belongs to the cinchona family, and
contains tonic properties. The Peruvian bark gatherers adulterate the true
cinchona bark with this, but it may be detected by its white inner surface,
its less powerful bitter taste, and a viscidity not possessed by the cinchonas.</p>

<p>136. <span class="smcap">Convolvulus scammonia.</span>&mdash;This plant furnishes the scammony of the druggists.</p>

<p>137. <span class="smcap">Cookia punctata.</span>&mdash;A small-growing tree from China, which produces a fruit
known as the Wampee. This fruit is a globular berry, with five or fewer compartments
filled with juice. It is much esteemed in China.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>138. <span class="smcap">Copaifera officinalis.</span>&mdash;This tree yields balsam of copaiba, used in medicine.
The balsam is collected by making incisions in the stem, when the liquor is
said to pour out copiously; as it exudes it is thin and colorless, but immediately
thickens and changes to a clear yellow. Like many other balsams, it
is nearly allied to the turpentines; it has a moderately agreeable smell, and
a bitter, biting taste of considerable duration. Distilled with water it yields
a limpid essential oil.</p>

<p>139. <span class="smcap">Copernica cerifera.</span>&mdash;The Carnuba, or wax palm of Brazil. It grows about 40
feet high, and has a trunk 6 or 8 inches thick, composed of very hard wood,
which is commonly employed in Brazil for building and other purposes. The
upper part of the young stem is soft, and yields a kind of sago, and the bitter
fruits are eaten by the Indians. The young leaves are coated with wax, called
Carnaub wax, which is detached by shaking them, and then melted and run
into cakes; it is harder than beeswax, and has been used for making candles.
The leaves are used for thatch, and, when young, are eaten by cattle.</p>

<p>140. <span class="smcap">Coprosma robusta.</span>&mdash;A cinchonaceous shrub. The leaves of this plant were
formerly used in some of the religious ceremonies of the New Zealanders.</p>

<p>141. <span class="smcap">Cordia myxa.</span>&mdash;This produces succulent, mucilaginous, and emollient fruits,
which are eaten. These qualities, combined with a slight astringency, have
led to their use as pectorals, known as Sebestens. The wood of this tree is
said to have furnished the material used by the Egyptians in the construction
of their mummy cases; it is also considered to be one of the best woods for
kindling fire by friction.</p>

<p>142. <span class="smcap">Cordyline australis.</span>&mdash;The Australian Ti, or cabbage tree, a palm-like plant
of 15 to 20 feet in height. The whole plant is fibrous, and it has been suggested
as good for a paper-making material. The juice of the roots and stem
contains a small amount of sugar, and has been employed for procuring
alcohol.</p>

<p>143. <span class="smcap">Corypha umbraculifera.</span>&mdash;The Talipot palm, a native of Ceylon, producing
gigantic fan-like leaves. These leaves have prickly stalks 6 or 7 feet long,
and when fully expanded form a nearly complete circle of 13 feet in diameter.
Large fans made of these leaves are carried before people of rank
among the Cinghalese; they are also commonly used as umbrellas, and tents
are made by neatly joining them together; they are also used as a substitute
for paper, being written upon with a stylus. Some of the sacred books of
the Cinghalese are composed of strips of them. The hard seeds are used by
turners.</p>

<p>144. <span class="smcap">Couroupita guianensis.</span>&mdash;The fruit of this tree is called, from its appearance,
the cannon-ball fruit; its shell is used as a drinking vessel, and when fresh
the pulp is of an agreeable flavor.</p>

<p>145. <span class="smcap">Crat&aelig;va gynandra.</span>&mdash;This West Indian tree yields a small fruit which has a
strong smell of garlic, hence it is called the garlic pear. The bark is bitter
and used as a tonic.</p>

<p>146. <span class="smcap">Crescentia cujete.</span>&mdash;The calabash tree of the West Indies, where it is valued
for the sake of its fruits, which resemble pumpkins in appearance and occasionally
reach a diameter of 18 inches. Divested of their pulp, which is
not edible, they serve various useful domestic purposes, for carrying water,
and even as kettles for cooking. They are strong and light.</p>

<p>147. <span class="smcap">Croton balsamiferum.</span>&mdash;This West Indian shrub is sometimes called seaside
balsam or sage. A thick, yellowish, aromatic juice exudes from the extremities
of the broken branches, or wherever the stem has been wounded.
In Martinique a liquor called <i>Eau de Mantes</i> is distilled from this balsamic
juice with spirits of wine. The young leaves and branches are used in
warm baths, on account of their agreeable fragrance and reputed medicinal
virtues.</p>

<p>148. <span class="smcap">Croton eleutheria.</span>&mdash;This plant furnishes cascarilla bark, used as an aromatic
bitter tonic, having no astringency. It has a fragrant smell when
burnt, on which account it has been mixed with smoking tobacco.</p>

<p>149. <span class="smcap">Croton tiglium.</span>&mdash;A plant of the family <i>Euphorbiace&aelig;</i>, from the Indian
Archipelago, which produces the seeds from whence croton oil is extracted.
It is a very powerful medicine, and even in pressing the seeds for the purpose
of extracting the oil, the workmen are subject to irritation of the eyes
and other casualties.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>150. <span class="smcap">Cubeba officinalis.</span>&mdash;A native of Java, which furnishes the cubeb fruits of
commerce. These fruits are like black pepper, but stalked, and have an
acrid, hot, aromatic taste; frequently used medicinally.</p>

<p>151. <span class="smcap">Curcas purgans.</span>&mdash;A tropical plant cultivated in many warm countries for
the sake of its seeds, known as physic nuts. The juice of the plant, which
is milky, acrid, and glutinous, produces an indelible brown stain on linen.
The oil from the seeds is used for burning in lamps; and in paints. In
China it is boiled with oxide of iron and used as a varnish. It is also used
medicinally.</p>

<p>152. <span class="smcap">Curcuma longa.</span>&mdash;A plant belonging to the <i>Zingiberace&aelig;</i>, the roots of which
furnish turmeric. This powder is used in India as a mild aromatic, and
for other medicinal purposes. It also enters into the composition of curry-powder,
and a sort of arrowroot is made from the young tubers.</p>

<p>153. <span class="smcap">Curcuma zedoaria.</span>&mdash;This plant furnishes zedoary tubers, much used in India
as aromatic tonics.</p>

<p>154. <span class="smcap">Cyathea medullaris.</span>&mdash;This beautiful tree fern is a native of Australia,
where it attains a height of 25 to 30 feet, having fronds from 10 to 15 feet in
length. It contains a pulpy substance in the center of the stem, of a starchy,
mucilaginous nature, which is a common article of food with the natives.
The trees have to be destroyed in order to obtain it.</p>

<p>155. <span class="smcap">Cybistax antisyphilitica.</span>&mdash;A plant of the order of <i>Bignoniace&aelig;</i>, called
Atunyangua in the Andes of Peru, where the inhabitants dye their cotton
clothes by boiling them along with the leaves of this plant; the dye is a permanent
blue. The bark of the young shoots is much employed in medicine.</p>

<p>156. <span class="smcap">Cycas revoluta.</span>&mdash;The sago palm of gardens. The stem of the plants
abounds in starch, which is highly esteemed in Japan. A gum exudes from
the trunk of the old plant, which is employed medicinally by the natives of
India.</p>

<p>157. <span class="smcap">Cycas circinalis.</span>&mdash;A native of Malabar, where a kind of sago is prepared
from the seeds, which are dried and powdered; medicinal properties are also
attributed to the seeds.</p>

<p>158. <span class="smcap">Dacrydium franklinii.</span>&mdash;Called Huon pine, because of its being found near
the Huon River, in Tasmania. It belongs to the yew family. It furnishes
valuable timber, very durable, and is used for ship and house building;
some of the wood is very beautifully marked, and is used in furniture making
and cabinetwork.</p>

<p>159. <span class="smcap">Dalbergia sissoo.</span>&mdash;A tree of northern India, the timber of which is known
as Sissum wood. This wood is strong, tenacious, and compact, much used
for railway ties and for gun-carriages.</p>

<p>160. <span class="smcap">Damara australis.</span>&mdash;A singular plant of the <i>Conifer&aelig;</i> family, called the
Kauri pine. It forms a tree 150 to 200 feet in height, and produces a hard,
brittle resin-like copal, which is used in varnish.</p>

<p>161. <span class="smcap">Dasylirion acrotrichum.</span>&mdash;A plant of the pineapple family, from Mexico.
The leaves contain a fine fiber, which may be ultimately more extensively
utilized than it is at present.</p>

<p>162. <span class="smcap">Desmodium gyrans.</span>&mdash;An interesting plant of the pea family, called the moving
plant, on account of the rotatory motion of the leaflets. These move in
all conceivable ways, either steadily or by jerks. Sometimes only one leaf or
two on the plant will be affected; at other times a nearly simultaneous
movement may be seen in all the leaves. These movements are most energetic
when the thermometer marks about 80&deg;. This motion is not due to
any external or mechanical irritation.</p>

<p>163. <span class="smcap">Dialium acutifolium.</span>&mdash;The velvet tamarind, so called, from the circumstance
that its seed-pods are covered with a beautiful black velvet down.
The seeds are surrounded by a farinaceous pulp of an agreeable acid taste.</p>

<p>164. <span class="smcap">Dialium indum.</span>&mdash;The tamarind plum, which has a delicious pulp of slightly
acid flavor.</p>

<p>165. <span class="smcap">Dicksonia antarctica.</span>&mdash;The large fern tree of Australia. This plant attains
the height of 30 or more feet, and its fronds or leaves spread horizontally
some 20 to 25 feet. It is found in snowy regions, and would be perfectly
hardy south. It is one of the finest objects of the vegetable kingdom when
of sufficient size to show its true beauties.</p>

<p>166. <span class="smcap">Dieffenbachia seguina.</span>&mdash;This has acquired the name of dumb cane, in consequence
of its fleshy, cane-like stems, rendering speechless any person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
who may happen to bite them, their acrid poison causing the tongue to
swell to an immense size. An ointment for applying to dropsical swellings
is prepared by boiling the juice in lard. Notwithstanding its acridity, a
wholesome starch is prepared from the stem.</p>

<p>167. <span class="smcap">Dillenia speciosa.</span>&mdash;An East Indian tree, bearing a fruit which is used in curries
and for making jellies. Its slightly acid juice, sweetened with sugar,
forms a cooling beverage. The wood is very tough, and is used for making
gun-stocks.</p>

<p>168. <span class="smcap">Dion edule.</span>&mdash;A Mexican plant, bearing large seeds containing a quantity of
starch, which is separated and used as arrowroot.</p>

<p>169. <span class="smcap">Diospyros ebenum.</span>&mdash;An East Indian tree which in part yields the black
ebony wood of commerce, much used in fancy cabinetwork and turnery,
door knobs, pianoforte keys, etc.</p>

<p>170. <span class="smcap">Diospyros kaki.</span>&mdash;The Chinese date plum or persimmon. The fruits vary in size
from that of a medium-sized apple to that of a large pear; they also vary
much in their flavor and consistency, some being firm, and others having a
soft custard-like pulp, very sweet and luscious. The Chinese dry them in
the sun and make them into sweetmeats; they are sometimes imported,
and in appearance resemble large-sized preserved figs. These plants are
being quite largely cultivated in some of the southern States, and the fruit
is entering commerce.</p>

<p>171. <span class="smcap">Dipterix odorata.</span>&mdash;This leguminous plant yields the fragrant seed known
as Tonka bean, used in scenting snuff and for other purposes of perfumery.
The odor resembles that of new-mown hay, and is due to the presence of
<i>coumarine</i>. The tree is a native of Cayenne and grows 60 to 80 feet high.</p>

<p>172. <span class="smcap">Dorstenia contrayerva.</span>&mdash;A plant from tropical America, the roots of which
are used in medicine under the name of Contrayerva root.</p>

<p>173. <span class="smcap">Drac&aelig;na draco.</span>&mdash;The Dragon's Blood tree of Teneriffe. This liliaceous
plant attains a great age and enormous size. The resin obtained from this
tree has been found in the sepulchral caves of the Cuanches, and hence it
is supposed to have been used by them in embalming the dead. Trees of
this species, at present in vigorous health, are supposed to be as old as the
pyramids of Egypt.</p>

<p>174. <span class="smcap">Drac&aelig;nopsis Australis.</span>&mdash;Ti or cabbage tree of New Zealand. The whole
of this plant is fibrous and has been used for paper making. The juice of
the roots and stem contains a small amount of sugar and has been used for
producing alcohol.</p>

<p>175. <span class="smcap">Drimys winteri.</span>&mdash;This plant belongs to the magnolia family and furnishes the
aromatic tonic known as Winter's bark. It is a native of Chili and the
Strait of Magalhaens.</p>

<p>176. <span class="smcap">Dryobalanops aromatica.</span>&mdash;A native of the Island of Sumatra. It furnishes
a liquid called camphor oil and a crystalline solid known as Sumatra or
Borneo camphor. Camphor oil is obtained from incisions in the tree, and
has a fragrant, aromatic odor. It has been used for scenting soap. The
solid camphor is found in cracks of the wood, and is obtained by cutting
down the tree, dividing it into blocks and small pieces, from the interstices
of which the camphor is extracted. It differs from the ordinary camphor
in being more brittle and not condensing on the sides of the bottle in which
it is kept. It is much esteemed by the Chinese, who attribute many virtues
to it. It has been long known and is mentioned by Marco Polo in the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p>177. <span class="smcap">Duboisia hopwoodii.</span>&mdash;The leaves of this Australian plant are chewed by the
natives of Central Australia, just as the Peruvians and Chilians masticate
the leaves of the <i>Erythroxylon coca</i>, to invigorate themselves during their
long foot journeys through the country. They are known as Pitury leaves.</p>

<p>178. <span class="smcap">Durio zibethinus.</span>&mdash;A common tree in the Malayan Islands, where its fruit
forms a great part of the food of the natives. It is said to have a most delicious
flavor combined with a most offensive odor, but when once the repugnance
of the peculiar odor is overcome it becomes a general favorite. The
unripe fruit is cooked and eaten, and the seeds roasted and used like chestnuts.</p>

<p>179. <span class="smcap">El&aelig;is guineensis.</span>&mdash;The African oil palm is a native of southwestern Africa,
but has been introduced into other regions. It grows to a height of 20 to 30<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
feet and bears dense heads of fruit. The oil is obtained by boiling the fruits
in water and skimming off the oil as it rises to the surface. It is used in the
manufacture of candles. In Africa it is eaten as butter by the natives.</p>

<p>180. <span class="smcap">El&aelig;is melanococca.</span>&mdash;A palm from tropical America which produces large
quantities of oil.</p>

<p>181. <span class="smcap">El&aelig;ocarpus hinau.</span>&mdash;A New Zealand tree, of the linden family. The bark
affords an excellent permanent dye, varying from light brown to deep black.
The fruits are surrounded by an edible pulp, and they are frequently pickled
like olives.</p>

<p>182. <span class="smcap">Elettaria cardamomum.</span>&mdash;This plant furnishes the fruits known as the Small
or Malabar cardamoms of commerce. The seeds are used medicinally for
their cordial aromatic properties, which depend upon the presence of a volatile
oil. In India the fruits are chewed by the natives with their betel.</p>

<p>183. <span class="smcap">Emblica officinalis.</span>&mdash;A plant belonging to <i>Euphorbiace&aelig;</i>, a native of India.
In Borneo the bark and young shoots are used to dye cotton black, for
which purpose they are boiled in alum. The fruits are made into sweetmeats,
with sugar, or eaten raw, but they are exceedingly acid; when ripe
and dry, they are used in medicine, under the name of <i>Myrobalani emblici</i>.
The natives of Travancore have a notion that the plant imparts a pleasant
flavor to water, and therefore place branches of the tree in their wells,
especially when the water is charged with an accumulation of impure
vegetable matter.</p>

<p>184. <span class="smcap">Enckea unguiculata.</span>&mdash;A plant of the family <i>Piperace&aelig;</i>, having an aromatic
fruit like a berry, with a thick rind. The roots are used medicinally in
Brazil.</p>

<p>185. <span class="smcap">Entada scandens.</span>&mdash;This leguminous plant has remarkable pods, which often
measure 6 or 8 feet in length. The seeds are about 2 inches across, and
half an inch thick, and have a hard, woody, and beautifully polished shell,
of a dark-brown or purplish color. These seeds are frequently converted
into snuff-boxes and other articles, and in the Indian bazars they are used
as weights.</p>

<p>186. <span class="smcap">Eriodendron anfractuosum.</span>&mdash;The silk-cotton, or God tree of the West
Indies. The fruit is a capsule, filled with a beautiful silky fiber, which is
very elastic, but can not be woven, and is only used for stuffing cushions.</p>

<p>187. <span class="smcap">Erythrina caffra.</span>&mdash;The Kaffir tree of South Africa. The wood is soft and
so light as to be used for floating fishing nets. The scarlet seeds are employed
for making necklaces. The Erythrinas, of which there are many species,
are mostly remarkable for the brilliant scarlet of their flowers, and are
known as Coral trees.</p>

<p>188. <span class="smcap">Erythrina umbrosa.</span>&mdash;This is a favorite tree for growing in masses, for the
purpose of sheltering cocoanut plantations, and inducing a proper degree
of moisture in their neighborhood.</p>

<p>189. <span class="smcap">Erythroxylon coca.</span>&mdash;The leaves of this plant, under the name of coca, are
much used by the inhabitants of South America as a masticatory. It forms
an article of commerce among the Indians, who carefully dry the leaves and
use them daily. Their use, in moderation, acts as a stimulant to the nervous
system and enables those who chew them to perform long journeys without
any other food. The use of coca in Peru is a very ancient custom, said to
have originated with the Incas. It is common throughout the greater part
of Peru, Quito, New Granada; and on the banks of the Rio Negro it is known
as Spadic. A principle, called <i>cocaine</i>, has been extracted from the leaves,
which is used in medicine.</p>

<p>190. <span class="smcap">Eucalyptus amygdalina.</span>&mdash;The peppermint tree, a native of Tasmania. It
produces a thin, transparent oil possessed of a pungent odor resembling oil
of lemons, and tasting like camphor, which has great solvent properties. The
genus <i>Eucalyptus</i> is extensive and valuable. The greater number form
large trees, known in Australia as gum trees.</p>

<p>191. <span class="smcap">Eucalyptus gigantea.</span>&mdash;This stringy bark gum furnishes a strong, durable
timber, used for shipbuilding and other purposes. <i>E. robusta</i> contains
large cavities in its stem, between the annual concentric circles of wood,
filled with a red gum. Many of the species yield gums and astringent
principles and also a species of manna. The timber of these trees has been
pronounced to be unsurpassed for strength and durability by any other
timber known. The leaves of these trees are placed vertically to the sun,
a provision suited to a dry and sultry climate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>192. <span class="smcap">Eucalyptus globulus.</span>&mdash;The blue gum, a rapid-growing tree, attaining to
a large size. Recently it has attracted attention and gained some repute in
medicine as an antiperiodic. The leaves have also been applied to wounds
with some success. It produces a strong camphor-smelling oil, which has a
mint-like taste, not at all disagreeable.</p>

<p>193. <span class="smcap">Eugenia acris.</span>&mdash;The wild clove or bayberry tree of the West Indies. In
Jamaica it is sometimes called the black cinnamon. The refreshing perfume
known as bay rum is prepared by distilling the leaves of this tree
with rum. It is stated that the leaves of the allspice are also used in
this preparation.</p>

<p>194. <span class="smcap">Eugenia jambosa.</span>&mdash;A tropical plant, belonging to the myrtle family, which
produces a pleasant rose-flavored fruit, known as the Roseapple, or Jamrosade.</p>

<p>195. <span class="smcap">Eugenia pimento.</span>&mdash;The fruits of this West Indian tree are known in commerce
as allspice; the berries have a peculiarly grateful odor and flavor,
resembling a combination of cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon; hence the
name of allspice. The leaves when bruised emit a fine aromatic odor, and
a delicate odoriferous oil is distilled from them, which is said to be used as
oil of cloves. The berries, bruised and distilled with water, yield the
pimento oil of commerce.</p>

<p>196. <span class="smcap">Eugenia ugni.</span>&mdash;This small-foliaged myrtaceous plant is a native of Chili. It
bears a glossy black fruit, which has an agreeable flavor and perfume, and
is highly esteemed in its native country. The plant is hardy in the Southern
States.</p>

<p>197. <span class="smcap">Euphorbia canariensis.</span>&mdash;This plant grows in abundance in the Canary
Islands and Teneriffe, in dry, rocky districts, where little else can grow,
and where it attains a height of 10 feet, with the branches spreading 15 or
20 feet. It is one of the kinds that furnish the drug known as <i>Euphorbium</i>.
The milky juice exudes from incisions made in the branches, and is so
acrid that it excoriates the hand when applied to it. As it hardens it falls
down in small lumps, and those who collect it are obliged to tie cloths over
their mouths and nostrils to exclude the small, dusty particles, as they produce
incessant sneezing. As a medicine its action is violent, and it is now
rarely employed. There are a vast number of species of <i>Euphorbia</i>, varying
exceedingly in their general appearance, but all of them having a milky
juice which contains active properties. Many of them can scarcely be distinguished
from cactuses so far as relates to external appearances, but the
milky exudation following a puncture determines their true character. <i>E.
grandidens</i> is a tall-growing, branching species, and attains a height of 30
feet. The natives of India use the juice of <i>E. antiquorum</i>, when diluted,
as a purgative. The juice of <i>E. heptagona</i> and other African species is employed
to poison arrows; the juice of <i>E. cotinifolia</i> is used for the same
purpose in Brazil. The roots of <i>E. gerardiana</i> and <i>E. pithyusa</i> are emetic,
while <i>E. thymifolia</i> and <i>E. hypericifolia</i> possess astringent and aromatic
properties. The poisonous principle which pervades these plants is more
or less dissipated by heat. The juice of <i>E. cattimandoo</i> furnishes caoutchouc
of a very good quality, which, however, becomes brittle, although
soaking in hot water renders it again pliable. <i>E. phosphorea</i> derives the
name from the fact of its sap emitting a phosphorescent light, on warm
nights, in the Brazilian forests.</p>

<p>198. <span class="smcap">Euterpe edulis.</span>&mdash;The assai palm of Para. It grows in swampy lands, and produces
a small fruit thinly coated with clotted flesh of which the inhabitants
of Para manufacture a beverage called assai. The ripe fruits are soaked
in warm water and kneaded until the fleshy pulp is detached. This, when
strained, is of a thick, creamy consistence, and, when thickened with
cassava farina and sweetened with sugar, forms a nutritious diet, and is
the daily food of a large number of the people.</p>

<p>199. <span class="smcap">Euterpe montana.</span>&mdash;The center portion of the upper part of the stem of this
West Indian palm, including the leaf bud, is eaten either when cooked as
a vegetable or pickled, but the tree must be destroyed in order to obtain it.</p>

<p>200. <span class="smcap">Exc&#339;caria sebifera.</span>&mdash;This Euphorbiaceous plant is the tallow tree of China.
The fruits, are about half an inch in diameter, and each contains three
seeds, thickly coated with a fatty substance which yields the tallow. This
is obtained by first steaming the seeds, then bruising them to loosen the fat
without breaking the seeds, which are removed by sifting. The fat is
then made into flat circular cakes and pressed, when the pure tallow exudes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in a liquid state and soon hardens into a white, brittle mass. Candles
made from this get soft in hot weather, which is prevented by coating them
with insect wax. A liquid oil is obtained from the seeds by pressing. The
tree yields a hard wood, used by the Chinese for printing blocks, and its
leaves are used in dyeing black.</p>

<p>201. <span class="smcap">Exogonium purga.</span>&mdash;This plant furnishes the true jalap-tubers of commerce.
They owe their well-known purgative properties to their resinous ingredients.
Various species of Ipom&#339;a furnish a spurious kind of this drug,
which is often put in the market as the genuine article.</p>

<p>202. <span class="smcap">Exostemma carib&aelig;um.</span>&mdash;This West Indian plant has become naturalized in
southern Florida. It belongs to the cinchona family and is known as
Jamaica bark. It is also known as Quinquina Caraibe. The bark is reputed
to be a good febrifuge, and also to be employed as an emetic. It is
supposed to contain some peculiar principle, as the fracture displays an
abundance of small crystals. The capsules, before they are ripe, are very
bitter, and their juice causes a burning itching on the lips.</p>

<p>203. <span class="smcap">Feronia elephantum.</span>&mdash;The wood apple or elephant apple tree of India,
belonging to the family <i>Aurantiace&aelig;</i>. It forms a large tree in Ceylon, and
yields a hard, heavy wood, of great strength. It yields a gum, which is
mixed with other gums and sold under the name of East Indian gum
arabic. The fruit is about the size of an orange, and contains a pulpy
flesh, which is edible, and a jelly is made from it, which is used in cases of
dysentery. The leaves have an odor like that of anise, and the native
India doctors employ them as a stomachic and carminative.</p>

<p>204. <span class="smcap">Fevillea cordifolia.</span>&mdash;The sequa or cacoon antidote of Jamaica. It belongs
to the cucumber family, and climbs to a great height up the trunks of
trees. The seeds are employed as a remedy in a variety of diseases, and
are considered an antidote against the effects of poison; they also contain
a quantity of semisolid fatty oil, which is liberated by pressing and boiling
them in water.</p>

<p>205. <span class="smcap">Ficus elastica.</span>&mdash;This plant is known as the india-rubber tree. It is a native
of the East Indies, and is the chief source of caoutchouc from that quarter
of the globe, although other species of Ficus yield this gum, as well as several
plants of other genera. It is a plant of rapid growth, and from the
larger branches roots descend to the earth as in the case of the banyan tree.</p>

<p>206. <span class="smcap">Ficus indica.</span>&mdash;The famous banyan tree of history. Specimens of this Indian
fig are mentioned as being of immense size. One in Bengal spreads over a
diameter of 370 feet. Another covered an area of 1,700 square yards. It
is one of the sacred trees of the Hindoos. It was known to the ancients.
Strabo describes it, and it is mentioned by Pliny. Milton also alludes to it
as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Branching so broad along, that in the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bending twigs take root; and daughters grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the mother tree; a pillared shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High overarched, with echoing walks between.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shelters in cool; and tends his pasturing herds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At loop-holes cut through thickest shade.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>207. <span class="smcap">Ficus religiosa.</span>&mdash;The pippul tree of the Hindoos, which they hold in such
veneration that, if a person cuts or lops off any of the branches, he is looked
upon with as great abhorrence as if he had broken the leg of one of their
equally sacred cows. The seeds are employed by Indian doctors in medicine.</p>

<p>208. <span class="smcap">Flacourtia sepiaria.</span>&mdash;A bushy shrub, used in India for hedges. Its fruit
has a pleasant, subacid flavor when perfectly ripe, but the unripe fruit is
extremely astringent. The Indian doctors use a liniment made of the bark
in cases of gout, and an infusion of it as a cure for snake bites.</p>

<p>209. <span class="smcap">Fourcroya cubense.</span>&mdash;This plant is closely related to the agave, and, like
many of that genus, furnishes a fine fiber, which is known in St. Domingo
as Cabuya fiber. These plants are very magnificent when in flower, throwing
up stems 20 to 30 feet in height, covered with many hundreds of yucca-like
blossoms.</p>

<p>210. <span class="smcap">Franciscea uniflora.</span>&mdash;A Brazilian plant called Mercurio vegetal; also known
as Manaca. The roots, and to some extent the leaves, are used in medicine;
the inner bark and all the herbaceous parts are nauseously bitter; it is regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
as a purgative, emetic, and alexipharmic; in overdoses it is an
acrid poison.</p>

<p>211. <span class="smcap">Fusanus acuminatus.</span>&mdash;A small tree of the Cape of Good Hope and Australia.
It bears a globular fruit of the size of a small peach, and is known in Australia
as the native peach. It has an edible nut, called the Quandang nut,
which is said to be as sweet and palatable as the almond.</p>

<p>212. <span class="smcap">Galipea officinalis.</span>&mdash;This South American tree furnishes Angostura bark,
which has important medical properties, some physicians in South America
preferring it to cinchona in the treatment of fevers. Its use has been
greatly retarded by bark of the deadly nux-vomica tree having been
inadvertently sold for it. As this bark is sometimes used in bitters, a mistake,
as above, might prove as fatal as cholera.</p>

<p>213. <span class="smcap">Garcinia mangostana.</span>&mdash;This tree produces the tropical fruit called mangosteen,
a beautiful fruit, having a thick, succulent rind, which contains an
astringent juice, and exudes a gum similar to gamboge. The esculent
interior contains a juicy pulp, of the whiteness and solubility of snow, and
of a refreshing, delicate, delicious flavor. The bark of the tree is used as a
basis for black dye, and it has also some medicinal value.</p>

<p>214. <span class="smcap">Garcinia morella.</span>&mdash;It is supposed that Siam gamboge is obtained from this
tree, also that known as Ceylon gamboge. The juice is collected by incising
the stems, or by breaking young twigs of the tree and securing the
yellow gum resinous exudations in hollow bamboos, where it is allowed to
harden. It is employed by artists in water colors and as a varnish for
lacquer work.</p>

<p>215. <span class="smcap">Garcinia pictoria.</span>&mdash;A fatty matter known as gamboge butter is procured
from the seeds of this tree in Mysore. They are pounded in a stone mortar,
then boiled till the butter or oil rises to the surface. It is used as a lamp
oil, and sometimes in food.</p>

<p>216. <span class="smcap">Gardenia florida</span> and <span class="smcap">Gardenia radicans</span>.&mdash;Cape Jasmines, so called from
a supposition that they were natives of the Cape of Good Hope. The
genus belongs to the cinchona family. <i>G. lucida</i> furnishes a fragrant
resin somewhat similar to myrrh. The fruit of <i>G. campanulata</i> is used
as a cathartic, and also to wash out stains in silks. <i>G. gummifera</i> yields a
resin something like Elemi.</p>

<p>217. <span class="smcap">Gastrolobium bilobum.</span>&mdash;A leguminous plant, having poisonous properties.
In western Australia, where it is a native, farmers often lose their
cattle through their eating the foliage. Cats and dogs that eat the flesh of
these poisoned cattle are also poisoned. <i>G. obtusum</i> and <i>G. spinosum</i>
possess similar properties.</p>

<p>218. <span class="smcap">Genipa americana.</span>&mdash;This belongs to the cinchona family, and produces the
fruit called genipap or marmalade box. It is about the size of an orange,
and has an agreeable flavor. The juice of the fruit yields a bluish-black
dye, called Canito or Lana-dye. This color is very permanent, and is much
used by Indians in South America.</p>

<p>219. <span class="smcap">Geonoma schottiana.</span>&mdash;A pretty Brazilian palm; the leaves are used for
thatching huts, and other parts of the plant are utilized.</p>

<p>220. <span class="smcap">Gouania domingensis.</span>&mdash;A plant of the buckthorn family, known in Jamaica
as Chaw-Stick, on account of its thin branches being chewed as an agreeable
stomachic. Tooth brushes are made by cutting pieces of the stem to
convenient lengths and fraying out the ends. A tooth powder is prepared
by pulverizing the dried stems. It is said to possess febrifugal properties,
and owing to its pleasant bitter taste it is used for flavoring cooling beverages.</p>

<p>221. <span class="smcap">Grevillea robusta.</span>&mdash;The silk oak tree of Australia; a tree that attains a
large size, and is remarkable for the graceful beauty of its foliage.</p>

<p>222. <span class="smcap">Grewia asiatica.</span>&mdash;This Indian tree represents a genus of plants of considerable
economic value. This particular species yields a profusion of small red
fruits which are used for flavoring drinks, having a pleasant acid flavor.
The fibrous inner bark is employed by the natives for making fishing nets,
ropes, twine, and for other similar purposes.</p>

<p>223. <span class="smcap">Grias cauliflora.</span>&mdash;The anchovy pear of Jamaica. The fruit is pickled and
eaten like the mango, having a similar taste.</p>

<p>224. <span class="smcap">Guaiacum officinale.</span>&mdash;The wood of this tree is called Lignum Vit&aelig;. A
resin, called gum guaiacum, exudes from the stem, and is otherwise obtained
from the wood by artificial means. It is of a greenish-brown color,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with a balsamic fragrance, and is remarkable for the changes of color it
undergoes when brought into contact with various substances. Gluten
gives it a blue tint: nitric acid and chlorin change it successively to green,
blue, and brown. The resin is used medicinally as also are the bark and wood.</p>

<p>225. <span class="smcap">Guazuma tomentosa.</span>&mdash;This plant is nearly allied to the chocolate-nut tree,
and yields fruits that abound in mucilage, as also does the bark of the
young shoots. The mucilage is given out in water, and has been used as a
substitute for gelatin or albumen in clarifying cane juice in the manufacture
of sugar. The timber is light, and is employed for the staves of sugar
hogsheads; it is known in Jamaica as bastard cedar. A strong fiber is
obtained from the young shoots.</p>

<p>226. <span class="smcap">Guilielma speciosa.</span>&mdash;The peach palm of Venezuela. The fruits are borne
in large drooping bunches, and their fleshy outer portion contains starchy
matter, which forms a portion of the food of the natives. They are cooked
and eaten with salt, and are said to resemble a potato in flavor. A beverage
is prepared by fermenting them in water, and the meal obtained from
them is made into bread. The wood of the old trees is black, and so hard
as to turn the edge of an ax.</p>

<p>227. <span class="smcap">H&aelig;matoxylon campechianum.</span>&mdash;The logwood tree. This dyestuff is largely
used by calico printers and other dyeing manufacturers. It is also used as
an ingredient in some writing inks. The heart wood is the part used for
dyeing. This is cut into chips which yield their color to water and alcohol.
The colors are various according to treatment, giving violet, yellow, purple,
and blue, but the consumption of logwood is for black colors, which are
obtained by alum and iron bases.</p>

<p>228. <span class="smcap">Hardenbergia monophylla.</span>&mdash;An Australian climbing plant of the leguminous
family. The long, carrot-shaped, woody root was called, by the early
settlers in that country, sarsaparilla, and is still used in infusion as a substitute
for that root.</p>

<p>229. <span class="smcap">Hartighsea spectabilis.</span>&mdash;A New Zealand tree, called Wahahe by the natives,
who employ the leaves as a substitute for hops, and also prepare from
them a spirituous infusion as a stomachic medicine.</p>

<p>230. <span class="smcap">Heliconia bihai.</span>&mdash;A plant of the order <i>Musace&aelig;</i>, from South America. The
young shoots are eaten by the natives, and the fruits are also collected and
used as food. It also furnishes a useful fiber.</p>

<p>231. <span class="smcap">Hevea brasiliensis.</span>&mdash;A tree of tropical America growing in damp forests,
especially in the Amazon valley, which, together with other trees called
siphonia furnish the Para rubber, or American caoutchouc. The sap is collected
from incisions made in the tree during the dry season, and is poured
over clay molds and dried by gentle heat, successive pourings being made
till a sufficiently thick layer is produced.</p>

<p>232. <span class="smcap">Hibiscus rosa sinensis.</span>&mdash;The flowers of this malvaceous plant contain a
quantity of astringent juice, and, when bruised, rapidly turn black or
deep purple; they are used by the Chinese ladies for dyeing their hair and
eyebrows, and in Java for blacking shoes.</p>

<p>233. <span class="smcap">Hibiscus sabdariffa.</span>&mdash;This species is known in the West Indies as red sorrel,
on account of the calyxes and capsules having an acid taste. They
are made into cooling drinks, by sweetening and fermentation. The bark
contains a strong useful fiber which makes good ropes if not too much
twisted. It is also known as the Roselle plant.</p>

<p>234. <span class="smcap">Hibiscus tiliaceus.</span>&mdash;A plant common to many tropical countries. Its wood
is extremely light when dry, and is employed by the Polynesians for getting
fire by friction, which is said to be a very tedious and tiresome operation,
and difficult to accomplish. Good fiber is also obtained from the bark.</p>

<p>235. <span class="smcap">Hippomane mancinella.</span>&mdash;This is the poisonous manchineel tree of South
America and other tropical regions. The virulent nature of the juice of this
tree has given it a reputation equal to that forced upon the upas tree of Java.
The juice is certainly very acrid, and even its smoke, when burning, causes
temporary blindness. The fruit is equally dangerous, and from its beautiful
appearance is sometimes partaken of by those who are unaware of its
deleterious properties, but its burning effects on the lips soon causes them
to desist. Indians are said to poison their arrows with the juice of this tree.</p>

<p>236. <span class="smcap">Hura crepitans.</span>&mdash;This tropical plant is known as the sand-box tree. Its
deep-furrowed, rounded, hard-shelled fruit is about the size of an orange,
and when ripe and dry, it bursts open with a sharp noise like the report of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a pistol; hence, it is also called the monkey's dinner bell. An emetic oil
is extracted from the seeds, and a venomous, milky juice is abundant in
all parts of the plant.</p>

<p>237. <span class="smcap">Hymen&aelig;a courbaril.</span>&mdash;The locust tree of the West Indies; also called algarroba
in tropical regions. This is one of the very largest growing trees
known, and living trees in Brazil are supposed to have been growing at
the commencement of the Christian era. The timber is very hard, and is
much used for building purposes. A valuable resin, resembling the anime
of Africa, exudes from the trunk, and large lumps of it are found about
the roots of old trees.</p>

<p>238. <span class="smcap">Hyph&aelig;ne thebaica.</span>&mdash;The doum, or doom palm, or gingerbread of Egypt; it
grows also in Nubia, Abyssinia, and Arabia. The fibrous, mealy husks of
the seeds are eaten, and taste almost like gingerbread. In the Thebias this
palm forms extensive forests, the roots spreading over the lurid ruins of one
of the largest and most splendid cities of the ancient world.</p>

<p>239. <span class="smcap">Icica heptaphylla.</span>&mdash;The incense tree of Guiana, a tall-growing tree, furnishing
wood of great durability. It is called cedar wood on account of
its fragrant odor. The balsam from the trunk is highly odoriferous, and
used in perfumery, and is known as balsam of acouchi; it is used in medicine.
The balsam and branches are burned as incense in churches.</p>

<p>240. <span class="smcap">Ilex paraguayensis.</span>&mdash;This is the tea plant of South America, where it occupies
the same important position in the domestic economy of the country
as the Chinese tea does in this. The <i>mat&eacute;</i> is prepared by drying and roasting
the leaves, which are then reduced to a powder and made into packages.
When used, a small portion of the powder is placed in a vessel, sugar
is added, and boiling water poured over the whole. It has an agreeable,
slightly aromatic odor, rather bitter to the taste, but very refreshing and
invigorating to the human frame after severe fatigue. It acts in some degree
as an aperient and diuretic, and in overdoses produces intoxication.
It contains the same active principle, theine as tea and coffee, but not their
volatile and empyreumatic oils.</p>

<p>241. <span class="smcap">Illicium anisatum.</span>&mdash;This magnoliaceous plant is a native of China, and its
fruit furnishes the star anise of commerce. In China, Japan, and India it
is used as a condiment in the preparation of food, and is chewed to promote
digestion, and the native physicians prescribe it as a carminative.
It is the flavoring ingredient of the preparation <i>Anisette de Bordeaux</i>. Its
flavor and odor are due to a volatile oil, which is extracted by distillation,
and sold as oil of anise, which is really a different article.</p>

<p>242. <span class="smcap">Illicium floridanum.</span>&mdash;A native of the Southern States. The leaves are said
to be poisonous; hence, the plant is sometimes called poison bag. The bark
has been used as a substitute for cascarilla.</p>

<p>243. <span class="smcap">Illicium religiosum.</span>&mdash;A Japanese species, which reaches the size of a small
tree, and is held sacred by the Japanese, who form wreaths of it with which
to decorate the tombs of their deceased friends, and they also burn the
fragrant bark as incense. Their watchmen use the powdered bark for
burning in graduated tubes, in order to mark the time, as it consumes slowly
and uniformly. The leaves are said to possess poisonous properties.</p>

<p>244. <span class="smcap">Indigofera tinctoria.</span>&mdash;The indigo plant, a native of Asia, but cultivated
and naturalized in many countries. The use of indigo as a dye is of great
antiquity. Both Dioscorides and Pliny mention it, and it is supposed to
have been employed by the ancient Egyptians. The indigo of commerce is
prepared by throwing the fresh cut plants into water, where they are
steeped for twelve hours, when the water is run off into a vessel and agitated
in order to promote the formation of the blue coloring matter, which
does not exist ready formed in the tissues of the plant, but is the result of
the oxidation of other substances contained in them. The coloring matter
then settles at the bottom; it is then boiled to a certain consistency and
afterwards spread out on cloth frames, where it is further drained of water
and pressed into cubes or cakes for market.</p>

<p>245. <span class="smcap">Ipom&#339;a purga.</span>&mdash;A species of jalap is obtained from this convolvulaceous
plant; this is a resinous matter contained in the juices.</p>

<p>246. <span class="smcap">Iriartella setigera.</span>&mdash;A South American palm growing in the underwood
of the forests on the Amazon and Rio Negro. The Indians use its slender
stems for making their blow pipes or gravatanas, through which they blow
small poisoned arrows with accuracy to a considerable distance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>247. <span class="smcap">Jambosa malaccensis.</span>&mdash;This Indian plant belongs to the myrtle family. It
produces a good-sized edible fruit known as the Malay apple.</p>

<p>248. <span class="smcap">Jasminum sambac trifoliatum.</span>&mdash;A native of South America. The flowers
are very fragrant, and an essential oil, much used in perfumery under the
name of jasmine oil, is obtained from this and other species.</p>

<p>249. <span class="smcap">Jatropha clauca.</span>&mdash;An East Indian plant the seeds of which when crushed
furnish an oil which is used in medicine.</p>

<p>250. <span class="smcap">Jatropha curcas.</span>&mdash;The physic nut tree of tropical America. This plant contains
a milky, acrid, glutinous juice, which forms a permanent stain when
dropped on linen, and which might form a good marking ink. Burning oil is
expressed from the seeds in the Philippine Islands; the oil, boiled with oxide
of iron, is used in China as a varnish. It is used in medicine in various
ways, the leaves for fomentations, the juice in treating ulcers, and the seeds
as purgatives.</p>

<p>251. <span class="smcap">Jub&aelig;a spectabilis.</span>&mdash;The coquito palm of Chili. The seed or nut is called
cokernut, and has a pleasant, nutty taste. These are used by the Chilian confectioners
in the preparation of sweetmeats, and by the boys as marbles,
being in shape and size like them. The leaves are used for thatching, and
the trunks or stems are hollowed out and converted into water pipes. A
sirup called Miel de Palma or palm honey, is prepared by boiling the sap
of this tree to the consistency of treacle, and is much esteemed for domestic
use as sugar. The sap is obtained by cutting off the crown of leaves
when it immediately begins to flow and continues for several months provided
a thin slice is shaved off the top every morning. Full-grown trees
will thus yield 90 gallons.</p>

<p>252. <span class="smcap">K&aelig;mpferia galanga.</span>&mdash;This plant belongs to the family of gingers. The
root stocks have an aromatic fragrance and are used medicinally in India
as well as in the preparation of perfumery. The flowers appear before the
leaves upon very short stems.</p>

<p>253. <span class="smcap">Kigelia pinnata.</span>&mdash;This plant is interesting from the circumstance of its being
held sacred in Nubia, where the inhabitants celebrate their religious festivals
under it by moonlight, and poles made of its wood are erected as symbols of
special veneration before the houses of their great chiefs. The fruits, which
are very large, when cut in half and slightly roasted, are employed as an
outward application to relieve pains.</p>

<p>254. <span class="smcap">Krameria triandra.</span>&mdash;This is one of the species that yield the rhatany roots
of commerce. In Peru an extract is made from this species, which is a mild,
easily assimilated, astringent medicine. It acts as a tonic, and is used in
intermittent and putrid fevers. It is also styptic, and when applied in plasters
is used in curing ulcers. The color of the infusion of the roots is blood-red,
on which account it is used to adulterate, or rather it forms an ingredient
in the fabrication of port wine.</p>

<p>255. <span class="smcap">Kydia calycina.</span>&mdash;An Indian plant of the family <i>Byttneriace&aelig;</i>. The bark is
employed in infusion as a sudorific and in cutaneous diseases, and its fibrous
tissue is manufactured into cordage.</p>

<p>256. <span class="smcap">Lagetta lintearia.</span>&mdash;The lace-bark tree of Jamaica. The inner bark consists
of numerous concentric layers of fibers, which interlace in all directions,
and thus present a great resemblance to lace. Articles of apparel are made
of it. Caps, ruffles, and even complete suits of lace are made with it. It
bears washing with common soap, and when bleached in the sun acquires a
degree of whiteness equal to the best artificial lace. Ropes made of it are
very durable and strong.</p>

<p>257. <span class="smcap">Lansium domesticum.</span>&mdash;A low-growing tree of the East Indies, which is cultivated
to some extent for its fruit, which is known in Java and Malacca as
lanseh fruit, and is much esteemed for its delicate aroma; the pulp is of
somewhat firm consistence and contains a cooling, refreshing juice.</p>

<p>258. <span class="smcap">Lapageria rosea.</span>&mdash;A twining plant from Chili. The flowers are very beautiful,
and are succeeded by berries, which are said to be sweet and eatable.
The root has qualities closely resembling sarsaparilla and used for the same
purpose.</p>

<p>259. <span class="smcap">Latania rubra.</span>&mdash;A very beautiful palm from the Mauritius. The fruit contains
a small quantity of pulp, which is eaten by the natives, but is not considered
very palatable by travelers.</p>

<p>260. <span class="smcap">Lawsonia inermis.</span>&mdash;This is the celebrated henna of the East. The use of the
powdered leaves as a cosmetic is very general in Asia and northern Africa,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the practice having descended from very remote ages, as is proved by the
Egyptian mummies, the parts dyed being usually the finger and toe nails,
the tips of the fingers, the palms of the hands, and soles of the feet, receiving
a reddish color, considered by Oriental belles as highly ornamental.
Henna is prepared by reducing the leaves to powder, and when used is
made into a pasty mass with water and spread on the part to be dyed, being
allowed to remain for twelve hours. The plant is known in the West Indies
as Jamaica Mignonette.</p>

<p>261. <span class="smcap">Lecythis ollaria.</span>&mdash;This tree produces the hard urn-shaped fruits known in
Brazil as monkey cups. The seeds are eatable and sold as Sapucaia nuts.
The fruit vessels are very peculiar, being 6 inches in diameter and having
closely fitting lids, which separate when the seeds are mature. The bark is
composed of a great number of layers, not thicker than writing paper,
which the Indians separate and employ as cigar wrappers.</p>

<p>262. <span class="smcap">Leptospermum lanigerum.</span>&mdash;A plant known throughout Australia as Captain
Cook's tea tree, from the circumstance that, on the first landing of this navigator
in that country, he employed a decoction of the leaves of this plant
as a corrective to the effects of scurvy among his crew, and this proved an
efficient medicine. Thickets of this plant, along the swampy margin of
streams, are known as Tea-tree scrubs. It is also known among the natives
as the Manuka plant. The wood is hard and heavy, and was formerly used
for making sharp-pointed spears. It belongs to the myrtle family of plants.</p>

<p>263. <span class="smcap">Licuala acutifida.</span>&mdash;This palm is a native of the island of Pulo-Penango, and
yields canes known by the curious name of Penang Lawyers. It is a low-growing
plant, its stems averaging an inch in diameter. The stems are converted
into walking canes by scraping their rough exteriors and straightening
them by means of fire heat.</p>

<p>264. <span class="smcap">Limonia acidissima.</span>&mdash;An East India shrub which produces round fruits about
the size of damson plums, of a yellowish color, with reddish or purplish
tints. They are extremely acid, and the pulp is employed in Java as a substitute
for soap.</p>

<p>265. <span class="smcap">Livistona australis.</span>&mdash;This is one of the few palms found in Australia. The
unexpanded leaves, prepared by being scalded and dried in the shade, are
used for making hats, while the still younger and more tender leaves are
eaten like cabbage.</p>

<p>266. <span class="smcap">Lucuma mammosum.</span>&mdash;This sapotaceous plant is cultivated for its fruit, which
is called marmalade, on account of its containing a thick agreeably flavored
pulp, bearing some resemblance in appearance and taste to quince marmalade.
A native of South America.</p>

<p>267. <span class="smcap">Maba geminata.</span>&mdash;The ebony wood of Queensland. The heart wood is black,
and the outside wood of a bright red color. It is close-grained, hard, heavy,
elastic and tough, and takes a high polish.</p>

<p>268. <span class="smcap">Macadamia ternifolia.</span>&mdash;An Australian tree which produces an edible nut
called the Queensland nut. This fruit is about the size of a walnut, and
within a thick pericarp, a smooth brown-colored nut, inclosing a
kernel of a rich and agreeable flavor, resembling in some degree that of a
filbert.</p>

<p>269. <span class="smcap">Mach&aelig;rium firmum.</span>&mdash;A South American tree which furnishes a portion of the
rosewood of commerce. Various species of the genus, under the common
Brazilian name of Jaccaranda, are said to yield this wood, but there is
some uncertainty about the origin of the various commercial rosewoods.</p>

<p>270. <span class="smcap">Maclura tinctoria.</span>&mdash;The fustic tree. Large quantities of the bright yellow
wood of this tree are exported from South America for the use of dyers,
who obtain from it shades of yellow, brown, olive, and green. A concentrated
decoction of the wood deposits, on cooling, a yellow crystalline matter
called Morine. This tree is sometimes called old fustic, in order to
distinguish it from another commercial dye called young fustic, which is
obtained in Europe from a species of Rhus.</p>

<p>271. <span class="smcap">Macropiper methysticum.</span>&mdash;A plant of the pepper family, which furnishes the
root called Ava by the Polynesians. It has narcotic properties, and is employed
medicinally, but is chiefly remarkable for the value attached to it as a
narcotic and stimulant beverage, of which the natives partake before they
commence any important business or religious rites. It is used by chewing
the root and extracting the juice, and has a calming rather than an intoxicating
effect. It is a filthy preparation, and only partaken of by the lower
classes of Feejeeans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>272. <span class="smcap">Macrozamia denisonii.</span>&mdash;An Australian cycad, the seeds of which contain a
large amount of farina, or starchy matter, which formerly supplied a considerable
amount of food for the natives of that country. The fresh seeds
are very acrid, but when steeped in water and roasted they become palatable
and nutritious.</p>

<p>273. <span class="smcap">Malpighia glabra.</span>&mdash;A low-growing tree of the West Indies, which produces
an edible fruit called the Barbadoes cherry.</p>

<p>274. <span class="smcap">Mammea Americana.</span>&mdash;The fruit of this tree, under the name of mammee
apple, is very much esteemed in tropical countries. It often attains a size of
6 or 8 inches in diameter and is of a yellow color. The outer rind and the
pulp which immediately surrounds the seeds are very bitter, but the intermediate
is sweet and aromatic. The seeds are used as anthelmintics, an
aromatic liquor is distilled from the flowers, and the acrid, resinous gum
distilled from the bark is used to destroy insects.</p>

<p>275. <span class="smcap">Manettia cordifolia.</span>&mdash;This climbing-plant is a native of South America, and
belongs to the family of <i>Cinchonace&aelig;</i>. The rind of the root has emetic
properties, and is used in Brazil for dropsy and other diseases. It is also
exported under the name of Ipecacuan, chiefly from Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>276. <span class="smcap">Mangifera indica.</span>&mdash;The mango, in some of its varieties esteemed as the
most delicious of tropical fruits, while many varieties produce fruit whose
texture resembles cotton and tastes of turpentine. The unripe fruit is
pickled. The pulp contains gallic and citric acid. The seeds possess
anthelmintic properties. A soft gum resin exudes from the wounded bark,
which is used medicinally.</p>

<p>277. <span class="smcap">Manicaria saccifera.</span>&mdash;Bussu palm of South America. Its large leaves are
used for thatching roofs, for which purpose they are well fitted and very
durable. The fibrous spathe furnishes a material of much value to the natives.
This fibrous matter when taken off entire is at once converted into
capital bags, in which the Indian keeps the red paint for his toilet, or the
silk cotton for his arrows, or he stretches out the larger ones to make himself
a cap of nature's own weaving, without seam or joint.</p>

<p>278. <span class="smcap">Manihot utilissima.</span>&mdash;This euphorbiaceous plant yields cassava or mandiocca
meal. It is extensively cultivated in tropical climates and supplies a great
amount of food. The root is the part used, and in its natural condition is
a most virulent poison, but by grating the roots to a pulp the poison is expelled
by pressure, and altogether dissipated by cooking. The expressed
juice, when allowed to settle, deposits the starch known as tapioca.</p>

<p>279. <span class="smcap">Maranta arundinacea.</span>&mdash;The arrowroot plant, cultivated for its starch.
The tubers being reduced to pulp with water, the fecula subsides, and is
washed and dried for commerce. It is a very pure kind of starch, and very
nutritious. The term arrowroot is said to be derived from the fact that
the natives of the West Indies use the roots of the plant as an application
to wounds made by poison arrows.</p>

<p>280. <span class="smcap">Mauritia flexuosa.</span>&mdash;The Moriche, or Ita palm, very abundant on the banks
of the Amazon, Rio Negro, and Orinoco Rivers. In the delta of the latter
it occupies swampy tracts of ground, which are at times completely
inundated, and present the appearance of forests rising out of the water.
These swamps are frequented by a tribe of Indians called Guaranes, who
subsist almost entirely upon the produce of this palm, and during the period
of the inundations suspend their dwellings from the tops of its tall stems.
The outer skin of the young leaves is made into string and cord for the
manufacture of hammocks. The fermented sap yields palm wine, and
another beverage is prepared from the young fruits, while the soft inner
bark of the stem yields a farinaceous substance like sago.</p>

<p>281. <span class="smcap">Maximiliana regia.</span>&mdash;An Amazonian palm called Inaja. The spathes are so
hard that, when filled with water, they will stand the fire, and are sometimes
used by the Indians as cooking utensils. The Indians who prepare
the kind of rubber called bottle rubber, make use of the hard stones of the
fruit as fuel for smoking and drying the successive layers of milky juice as
it is applied to the mold upon which the bottles are formed. The outer
husk, also, yields a kind of saline flour used for seasoning their food.</p>

<p>282. <span class="smcap">Melaleuca minor.</span>&mdash;A native of Australia and the islands of the Indian Ocean.
The leaves, being fermented, are distilled, and yield an oil known as cajuput
or cajeput oil, which is green, and has a strong aromatic odor. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
valuable as an antispasmodic and stimulant, and at one time had a great
reputation as a cure for cholera. In China the leaves are used as a tonic in
the form of decoction.</p>

<p>283. <span class="smcap">Melicocca bijuga.</span>&mdash;This sapindaceous tree is plentiful in tropical America
and the West Indies, and is known as the Genip tree. It produces numerous
green egg-shaped fruits, an inch in length, possessing an agreeable
vinous and somewhat aromatic flavor, called honey berries or bullace plums.
The wood of the tree is hard and heavy.</p>

<p>284. <span class="smcap">Melocactus communis.</span>&mdash;Commonly called the Turk's Cap cactus, from the
flowering portion on the top of the plant being of a cylindrical form and
red color, like a fez cap. Notwithstanding that they grow in the most dry
sterile places, they contain a considerable quantity of moisture, which is
well known to mules, who resort to them when very thirsty, first removing
the prickles with their feet.</p>

<p>285. <span class="smcap">Mesembryanthemum crystallinum.</span>&mdash;The ice plant, so called in consequence
of every part of the plant being covered with small watery pustules, which
glisten in the sun like fragments of ice. Large quantities of this plant are
collected in the Canaries and burned, the ashes being sent to Spain for the
use of glass makers. <i>M. edule</i> is called the Hottentot's fig, its fruit being
about the size of a small fig, and having a pleasant, acid taste when ripe.
<i>M. tortuosum</i> possesses narcotic properties, and is chewed by the Hottentots
to induce intoxication. The fruits possess hygrometric properties, the
dried, shriveled, capsules swelling out and opening so as to allow of the escape
of the seeds when moistened by rain, which at the same time fits the
soil for their germination.</p>

<p>286. <span class="smcap">Mikania guaco.</span>&mdash;A composite plant which has gained some notoriety as the
supposed Cundurango, the cancer-curing bark. It has long been supposed
to supply a powerful antidote for the bite of venomous serpents.</p>

<p>287. <span class="smcap">Mimusops balata.</span>&mdash;The Bully tree. This sapotaceous plant attains a great
size in Guiana and affords a dense, close-grained, valuable timber. Its
small fruits, about the size of coffee berries, are delicious when ripe. The
flowers also yield a perfume when distilled in water, and oil is expressed
from the seeds.</p>

<p>288. <span class="smcap">Mimusops elengi.</span>&mdash;A native of Ceylon, where its hard, heavy, durable timber
is used for building purposes. The seed also affords a great amount of oil.</p>

<p>289. <span class="smcap">Monodora grandiflora.</span>&mdash;An African plant belonging to the Anonace&aelig;. It
produces large fruit, which contains a large quantity of seeds about the size
of the Scarlet-Runner bean. They are aromatic and impart to the fruit the
odor and flavor of nutmeg; hence they are also known as calabash nutmegs.</p>

<p>290. <span class="smcap">Monstera deliciosa.</span>&mdash;This is a native of southern Mexico and yields a delicious
fruit with luscious pineapple flavor. The outer skin of the fruit, if
eaten, causes a stinging sensation in the mouth. This is easily removed
when the fruit is ripe. The leaves are singularly perforated with holes at
irregular intervals, from natural causes not sufficiently explained. In Trinidad
the plant is called the Ceriman.</p>

<p>291. <span class="smcap">Moringa pterygosperma.</span>&mdash;A native of the East Indies, where it bears the
name of horse-radish tree. The seeds are called ben nuts and supply a
fluid oil, highly prized by watchmakers, called oil of ben. The root is pungent
and stimulant and tastes like horse-radish.</p>

<p>292. <span class="smcap">Moronobea coccinea.</span>&mdash;The hog gum tree, which attains the height of 100 feet.
A fluid juice exudes from incisions in the trunk and hardens into a yellow
resin. It is said the hogs in Jamaica when wounded rub the injured part
against the tree so as to cover it with the gum, which possesses vulnerary
properties; hence its name. The resin has been employed as a substitute
for copaiba balsam, and plasters are made of it.</p>

<p>293. <span class="smcap">Mucuna pruriens.</span>&mdash;A tall climbing plant of the West Indies and other warm
climates. It is called the cowage, or cow-itch, on account of the seed pods
being covered with short brittle hairs, the points of which are finely serrated,
causing an unbearable itching when applied to the skin, which is
relieved by rubbing the part with oil. It is employed as a vermifuge. In
East Africa it is called Kitedzi. The sea beans found on the coast of Florida
are the seeds of <i>Mucuna altissima</i>. In Cuba these are called bulls' eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>294. <span class="smcap">Murraya exotica.</span>&mdash;A Chinese plant of the orange family. The fruit is succulent,
and the white flowers are very fragrant. They are used in perfumery.</p>

<p>295. <span class="smcap">Musa cavendishii.</span>&mdash;This is a valuable dwarf species of the banana from
southern China. It bears a large truss of fine fruit, and is cultivated to
some extent in Florida, where it endures more cold than the West India
species and fruits more abundantly.</p>

<p>296. <span class="smcap">Musa ensete.</span>&mdash;This Abyssinian species forms large foliage of striking beauty.
The food is dry and uneatable; but the base of the flower stalk is eaten by
the natives.</p>

<p>297. <span class="smcap">Musa sapientum.</span>&mdash;The banana plant. This has been cultivated and used as
food in tropical countries from very remote times, and furnishes enormous
quantities of nutritious food, and serves as a staple support to a large number
of the human race. The expressed juice is in some countries made into
a fermented liquor and the young shoots eaten as a vegetable.</p>

<p>298. <span class="smcap">Musa textilis.</span>&mdash;This furnishes the fiber known as manilla hemp, and is cultivated
in the Philippine Islands for this product. The finer kinds of the
fiber are woven into beautiful shawls and the coarser manufactured into
cordage for ships. The fiber is obtained from the leaf-stalks.</p>

<p>299. <span class="smcap">Muss&aelig;nda frondosa.</span>&mdash;This cinchonaceous plant is a native of Ceylon. The
bark and leaves are esteemed as tonic and febrifuges in the Mauritius,
where they are known as wild cinchona. The leaves and flowers are also
used as expectorants, and the juice of the fruit and leaves is used as an eyewash.</p>

<p>300. <span class="smcap">Myristica moschata.</span>&mdash;The nutmeg tree. The seed of this plant is the nutmeg
of commerce, and mace is the seed cover of the same. When the nuts
are gathered they are dried and the outer shell of the seed removed. The
mace is also dried in the sun and assumes a golden yellow color. The most
esteemed nutmegs come from Penang. At one time the nutmeg culture
was monopolized by the Dutch, who were in the habit of burning them
when the crop was too abundant, in order to keep up high prices.</p>

<p>301. <span class="smcap">Myrospermum peruiferum.</span>&mdash;This plant yields the drug known as balsam of
Peru, which is procured by making incisions in the bark, into which cotton
rags are thrust; a fire is then made round the tree to liquefy the balsam.
The balsam is collected by boiling the saturated rags in water. It is a thick,
treacly looking liquid, with fragrant aromatic smell and taste, and is not
used so much in medicine as it formerly was.</p>

<p>302. <span class="smcap">Myrospermum toluiferum.</span>&mdash;A South American tree, also called Myroxylon,
which yields the resinous drug called balsam of Tolu. This substance is
fragrant, having a warm, sweetish taste, and burns with an agreeable odor.
It is used in perfumery and in the manufacture of pastilles, also for flavoring
confectionery, as in Tolu lozenges.</p>

<p>303. <span class="smcap">Myrtus communis</span>&mdash;The common myrtle. This plant is supposed to be a native
of western Asia, but now grows abundantly in Italy, Spain, and the
south of France. Among the ancients the myrtle was held sacred to Venus
and was a plant of considerable importance, wreaths of it being worn by
the victors of the Olympic games and other honored personages. Various
parts of the plant were used in medicine, in cookery, and by the Tuscans
in the preparation of myrtle wine, called <i>myrtidanum</i>. It is still used in
perfumery, and a highly perfumed distillation is made from the flowers.
The fruits are very aromatic and sweet, and are eaten fresh or dried and
used as a condiment.</p>

<p>304. <span class="smcap">Nandina domestica.</span>&mdash;A shrub belonging to the family of berberries. It is a
native of China and Japan, where it is extensively cultivated for its fruits.
It is there known as Nandin.</p>

<p>305. <span class="smcap">Nauclea gambir.</span>&mdash;A native of the Malayan Islands, which yields the Gambir,
or Terra Japonica of commerce. This is prepared by boiling the leaves in
water until the decoction thickens, when it is poured into molds, where it
remains until it acquires the consistency of clay; it is then cut into cubes
and thoroughly dried. It is used as a masticatory in combination with the
areca nut and betel leaf, and also for tanning purposes.</p>

<p>306. <span class="smcap">Nectandra leucantha.</span>&mdash;The greenheart, or bibiru tree of British Guiana,
furnishing bibiru bark, which is used medicinally as a tonic and febrifuge,
its properties being due to the presence of an uncrystallizable alkaloid,
also found in the seeds. The seeds are also remarkable for containing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
upwards of 50 per cent of starch, which is made into a kind of bread by
the natives. The timber of this tree is extensively employed in shipbuilding,
its great strength and durability rendering it peculiarly well suited for
this purpose.</p>

<p>307. <span class="smcap">Nepenthes distillatoria.</span>&mdash;This pitcher plant is a native of Ceylon. The
pitchers are partly filled with water before they open; hence it was supposed
to be produced by some distilling process. In Ceylon the old, tough,
flexible stems are used as willows.</p>

<p>308. <span class="smcap">Nephelium litchi.</span>&mdash;This sapindaceous tree produces one of the valued indigenous
fruits of China. There are several varieties; the fruit is round,
about an inch and a half in diameter, with a reddish-colored, thin, brittle
shell. When fresh they are filled with a sweet, white, transparent, jelly-like
pulp. The Chinese are very fond of these fruits and consume large
quantities of them, both in the fresh state and when dried and preserved.</p>

<p>309. <span class="smcap">Nerium oleander.</span>&mdash;This is a well-known plant, often seen in cultivation, and
seemingly a favorite with many. It belongs to a poisonous family and is a
dangerous poison. A decoction of its leaves forms a wash, employed in the
south of Europe to destroy vermin; and its powdered wood and bark constitute
the basis of an efficacious rat-poison. Children have died from eating
the flowers. A party of soldiers in Spain, having meat to roast in camp,
procured spits and skewers of the tree, which there attains a large size. The
wood having been stripped of its bark, and brought in contact with the meat,
was productive of fatal consequences, for seven men died out of the twelve
who partook of the meat and the other five were for some time dangerously
ill.</p>

<p>310. <span class="smcap">Notel&aelig;a ligustrina.</span>&mdash;The Tasmanian iron wood tree. It is of medium growth
and furnishes wood that is extremely hard and dense, and used for making
sheaves for ships' blocks, and for other articles that require to be of
great strength. The plant belongs to the olive family.</p>

<p>311. <span class="smcap">Ochroma Lagopus.</span>&mdash;A tree that grows about 40 feet high, along the seashores
in the West Indies and Central America, and known as the cork wood.
The wood is soft, spongy, and exceedingly light, and is used as a substitute
for cork, both in stopping bottles and as floats for fishing nets. It is also
known as Balsa.</p>

<p>312. <span class="smcap">&#338;nocarpus batava.</span>&mdash;A South American palm, which yields a colorless,
sweet-tasted oil, used in Para for adulterating olive oil, being nearly as
good for this purpose as peanut oil, so largely used in Europe. A palatable
but slightly aperient beverage is prepared by triturating the fruits in water,
and adding sugar and mandiocca flour.</p>

<p>313. <span class="smcap">Olea europ&aelig;a.</span>&mdash;The European olive, which is popularly supposed to furnish
<i>all</i> the olive oil of commerce. It is a plant of slow growth and of as slow
decay. It is considered probable that trees at present existing in the Vale
of Gethsemane are those which existed at the commencement of the
Christian era. The oil is derived from the flesh of the fruit, and is pressed
out of the bruised pulp; inferior kinds are from second and third pressings.
The best salad oil is from Leghorn, and is sent in flasks surrounded by rush-work.
Gallipoli oil is transported in casks, and Lucca in jars. The pickling
olives are the unripe fruits deprived of a portion of their bitterness by
soaking in water in which lime and wood ashes are sometimes added, and
then bottled in salt and water with aromatics.</p>

<p>314. <span class="smcap">Ophiocaryon paradoxum.</span>&mdash;The snake nut tree of Guiana, so called on
account of the curious form of the embryo of the seed, which is spirally
twisted, so as to closely resemble a coiled-up blacksnake. The fruits are
as large as those of the black walnut, and although they are not known to
possess any medical properties, their singular snake-like form has induced
the Indians to employ them as an antidote to the poison of venomous
snakes. The plant belongs to the order of <i>Sapindace&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>315. <span class="smcap">Ophiorrhiza mungos.</span>&mdash;A plant belonging to the cinchona family, the roots of
which are reputed to cure snake bites. They are intensely bitter, and from
this circumstance they are called earth-galls by the Malays.</p>

<p>316. <span class="smcap">Ophioxylon serpentinum.</span>&mdash;A native of the East Indies, where the roots are
used in medicine as a febrifuge and alexipharmic.</p>

<p>317. <span class="smcap">Opuntia cochinellifera.</span>&mdash;A native of Mexico, where it is largely cultivated
in what are called the Nopal plantations for the breeding of the cochineal
insect. This plant and others are also grown for a similar purpose in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Canary Islands and Madeira. Some of these plantations contain fifty thousand
plants. Cochineal forms the finest carmine scarlet dye, and at least
there are 2,000 tons of it produced yearly, in value worth $2,000 per ton.</p>

<p>318. <span class="smcap">Opuntia tuna.</span>&mdash;This plant is a native of Mexico and South America generally.
It reaches a height of 15 to 20 feet and bears reddish-colored flowers,
followed by pear-shaped fleshy fruits 2 or 3 inches long, and of a rich carmine
color when ripe. It is cultivated for rearing the cochineal insect.
The fruits are sweet and juicy; sugar has been made from them. The juice
is used as a water-color and for coloring confectionery.</p>

<p>319. <span class="smcap">Oreodaphne Californica.</span>&mdash;The mountain laurel, or spice bush, of California.
When bruised it emits a strong, spicy odor, and the Spanish Americans
use the leaves as a condiment.</p>

<p>320. <span class="smcap">Oreodoxa oleracea.</span>&mdash;The West Indian cabbage palm, which sometimes attains
the height of 170 feet, with a straight cylindrical trunk. The semicylindrical
portions of the leaf-stalk are formed into cradles for children, or
made into splints for fractures. Their inside skin, peeled off while green,
and dried, looks like vellum, and can be written upon. The heart of young
leaves, or cabbage, is boiled as a vegetable or pickled, and the pith affords
sago. Oil is obtained from the fruit.</p>

<p>321. <span class="smcap">Ormosia dasycarpa.</span>&mdash;This is the West Indian bead tree, or necklace tree,
the seeds of which are roundish, beautifully polished, and of a bright scarlet
color, with a black spot at one end resembling beads, for which they are substitutes,
being made into necklaces, bracelets, or mounted in silver for studs
and buttons. It is a leguminous plant.</p>

<p>322. <span class="smcap">Osmanthus fragrans.</span>&mdash;This plant has long been cultivated as <i>Olea fragrans</i>.
The flowers have a fine fragrance, and are used by the Chinese to perfume
tea. It appears that they consider the leaves also valuable, for they are
frequently found in what is expected to be genuine tea.</p>

<p>323. <span class="smcap">Pachira alba.</span>&mdash;A South American tree the inner bark of which furnishes a
strong useful fiber, employed in the manufacture of ropes and various kinds
of cordage. The petals of the flowers are covered with a soft silky down
which is used for stuffing cushions and pillows.</p>

<p>324. <span class="smcap">Pandanus utilis.</span>&mdash;The screw pine of the Mauritius, where it is largely cultivated
for its leaves, which are manufactured into bags or sacks for the
exportation of sugar. They are also used for making other domestic vessels
and for tying purposes.</p>

<p>325. <span class="smcap">Pappea capensis.</span>&mdash;A small tree of the soapberry or sapindaceous family,
a native of the Cape of Good Hope, where the fruit is known as the wild
plum, from the pulp of which a vinous beverage and excellent vinegar are
prepared, and an eatable, though slightly purgative, oil is extracted from
the seeds. The oil is also strongly recommended for baldness and scalp
affections.</p>

<p>326. <span class="smcap">Papyrus antiquorum.</span>&mdash;The paper-reed of Asia, which yielded the substances
used as paper by the ancient Egyptians. The underground root-stocks
spread horizontally under the muddy soil, continuing to throw up stems as
they creep along. The paper was made from thin slices, cut vertically from
the apex to the base of the stem, between its surface and center. The slices
were placed side by side, according to the size required, and then, after
being wetted and beaten with a wooden instrument until smooth, were
pressed and dried in the sun.</p>

<p>327. <span class="smcap">Paritium elatum.</span>&mdash;The mountain mahoe, a malvaceous plant, that furnishes
the beautiful lace-like bark called Cuba bast, imported by nurserymen for
tying their plants. It was at one time only seen as employed in tying
together bundles of genuine Havana cigars. It forms a tree 40 feet or more
in height, and yields a greenish-blue timber, highly prized by cabinet-makers.</p>

<p>328. <span class="smcap">Parkia africana.</span>&mdash;The African locust tree, producing seeds which the natives
of Soudan roast, and then bruise and allow to ferment in water until they
become putrid, when they are carefully washed, pounded into powder, and
made into cakes, which are said to be excellent, though having a very
unpleasant smell. The pulp surrounding the seeds is made into a sweet
farinaceous preparation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>329. <span class="smcap">Parkinsonia aculeata.</span>&mdash;This leguminous plant is called Jerusalem Thorn.
Although a native of Southern Texas and Mexico, it is found in many tropical
countries, and is frequently used for making hedges. Indians in Mexico
employ it as a febrifuge and sudorific and also as a remedy for epilepsy.</p>

<p>330. <span class="smcap">Parmentiera cereifera.</span>&mdash;In the Isthmus of Panama this plant is termed
the Candle tree, because its fruits, often 4 feet long, look like yellow candles
suspended from the branches. They have a peculiar, apple-like smell,
and cattle that partake of the leaves or fruit have the smell communicated
to the beef if killed immediately.</p>

<p>331. <span class="smcap">Passiflora quadrangularis.</span>&mdash;The fruit of this plant is the Granadilla of the
tropics. The pulp has an agreeable though rather mawkish taste. The
root is said to possess narcotic properties, and is used in the Mauritius as an
emetic.</p>

<p>332. <span class="smcap">Paullinia sorbilis.</span>&mdash;The seeds of this climbing sapindaceous plant furnish
the famous guarana of the Amazon and its principal tributaries. The ripe
seeds, when thoroughly dried, are pounded into a fine powder, which made
into dough with water, is formed into cylindrical rolls, from 5 to 8 inches
long, becoming very hard when dry. It is used as a beverage, which is
prepared by grating about half a teaspoonful of one of the cakes into about
a teacup of water. It is much used by Brazilian miners, and is considered
a preventive of all manner of diseases. It is also used by travelers, who
supply themselves with it previous to undertaking lengthy or fatiguing
journeys. Its active principle is identical with theine, of which it contains
a larger quantity than exists in any other known plant, being more than
double that contained in the best black tea.</p>

<p>333. <span class="smcap">Pavetta borbonica.</span>&mdash;This belongs to the quinine family. The roots are bitter,
and are employed as a purgative; the leaves are also used medicinally.</p>

<p>334. <span class="smcap">Pedilanthus tithymaloides.</span>&mdash;This euphorbiaceous plant has an acrid, milky,
bitter juice; the root is emetic, and the dried branches are used medicinally.</p>

<p>335. <span class="smcap">Pereskia aculeata.</span>&mdash;The Barbadoes gooseberry, which belongs to the family
<i>Cactace&aelig;</i>. It grows about 15 feet in height, and produces yellow-colored,
eatable, and pleasant-tasted fruit, which is used in the West Indies for
making preserves.</p>

<p>336. <span class="smcap">Persea gratissima.</span>&mdash;The avocado or alligator pear, a common tree in the
West Indies. The fruits are pear-shaped, covered with a brownish-green
or purple skin. They are highly esteemed where grown, but strangers
do not relish them. They contain a large quantity of firm pulp, possessing
a buttery or marrow-like taste, and are frequently called vegetable marrow.
They are usually eaten with spice, lime-juice, pepper, and salt. An abundance
of oil, for burning and for soap-making, may be obtained from the
pulp. The seeds yield a deep, indelible black juice, which is used for marking
linen.</p>

<p>337. <span class="smcap">Ph&#339;nix dactylifera.</span>&mdash;The date palm, very extensively grown for its fruit,
which affords the principal food for a large portion of the inhabitants of
Africa, Asia, and southern Europe, and likewise of the various domestic
animals&mdash;dogs, horses, and camels being alike partial to it. The tree
attains to a great age, and bears annually for two hundred years. The
huts of the poorer classes are constructed of the leaves: the fiber surrounding
the bases of their stalks is used for making ropes and coarse cloth; the
stalks are used for the manufacture of baskets, brooms, crates, walking
sticks, etc., and the wood for building substantial houses; the heart of
young leaves is eaten as a vegetable; the sap affords an intoxicating beverage.
It may be further mentioned that the date was, probably, the palm
which supplied the "branches of palm trees" mentioned by St. John
(xii, 13) as having been carried by the people who went to meet Christ on
his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, and from which Palm Sunday takes
its name.</p>

<p>338. <span class="smcap">Phormium tenax.</span>&mdash;This plant is called New Zealand flax, on account of the
leaves containing a large quantity of strong, useful fiber, which is used by
the natives of that country for making strings, ropes, and articles of clothing.
The plant could be grown in this climate, and would no doubt be
largely cultivated if some efficient mode of separating the fiber could be
discovered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>339. <span class="smcap">Photinia japonica.</span>&mdash;The Japanese Medlar, or Chinese Lo-quat. It bears a
small oval fruit of an orange color when ripe, having a pleasant subacid
flavor. It stands ordinary winters in this climate, and forms a fine evergreen,
medium-sized tree.</p>

<p>340. <span class="smcap">Physostigma venenosum.</span>&mdash;A strong leguminous plant, the seeds of which
are highly poisonous, and are employed by the natives of Old Calabar as
an ordeal. Persons suspected of witchcraft or other crimes are compelled
to eat them until they vomit or die, the former being regarded as proof of
innocence, and the latter of guilt. Recently the seeds have been found
to act powerfully in diseases of the eye.</p>

<p>341. <span class="smcap">Phytelephas macrocarpa.</span>&mdash;The vegetable ivory plant, a native of the northern
parts of South America. The fruit consists of a collection of six or
seven drupes; each contains from six to nine seeds, the vegetable ivory of
commerce. The seeds at first contain a clear, insipid liquid; afterwards
it becomes milky and sweet, and changes by degrees until it becomes hard
as ivory. Animals eat the fruit in its young green state; a sweet oily pulp
incloses the seeds, and is collected and sold in the markets under the name
of Pipa de Jagua. Vegetable ivory may be distinguished from animal
ivory by means of sulphuric acid, which gives a bright red color with the
vegetable ivory, but none with the animal ivory.</p>

<p>342. <span class="smcap">Picrasma excelsa.</span>&mdash;This yields the bitter wood known as Jamaica Quassia.
The tree is common in Jamaica, where it attains the height of 50 feet. The
wood is of a whitish or yellow color, and has an intensely bitter taste.
Although it is used as a medicine in cases of weak digestion, it acts as a
narcotic poison on some animals, and the tincture is used as fly poison.
Cups made of this wood, when filled with water and allowed to remain for
some time, will impart tonic properties to the water.</p>

<p>343. <span class="smcap">Pinckneya pubens.</span>&mdash;This cinchonaceous plant is a native of the Southern
States and has a reputation as an antiperiodic. It is stated that incomplete
examinations have detected <i>cinchonine</i> in the bark. It has been used
successfully as a substitute for quinine. A thorough examination of this
plant seems desirable so that its exact medical value may be ascertained.</p>

<p>344. <span class="smcap">Piper betel.</span>&mdash;This plant belongs to the <i>Piperace&aelig;</i>. Immense quantities of
the leaves of this plant are chewed by the Malays. It tinges the saliva a
bright red and acts as a powerful stimulant to the digestive organs and salivary
glands; when swallowed it causes giddiness and other unpleasant
symptoms in persons unaccustomed to its use.</p>

<p>345. <span class="smcap">Piper nigrum.</span>&mdash;This twining shrub yields the pepper of commerce. It is cultivated
in the East and West Indies, Java, etc., the Malabar being held in
the highest esteem. The fruit when ripe is of a red color, but it is gathered
before being fully ripe and dried in the sun, when it becomes black and
shriveled. White pepper is the same fruit with the skin removed. When
analyzed, pepper is found to contain a hot acrid resin and a volatile oil, as
well as a crystalline substance called <i>piperin</i>, which has been recommended
as a substitute for quinine.</p>

<p>346. <span class="smcap">Pistacia lentiscus.</span>&mdash;The mastic tree, a native of southern Europe, northern
Africa, and western Asia. Mastic is the resin of the tree and is obtained
by making transverse incisions in the bark, from which it exudes in drops
and hardens into small semitransparent tears. It is consumed in large
quantities by the Turks for chewing to strengthen the gums and sweeten
the breath. It is also used for varnishing.</p>

<p>347. <span class="smcap">Pistacia terebinthus.</span>&mdash;The Cyprus turpentine tree. The turpentine flows
from incisions made in the trunk and soon becomes thick and tenacious,
and ultimately hardens. Galls gathered from this tree are used for tanning
purposes, one of the varieties of morocco leather being tanned with them.</p>

<p>348. <span class="smcap">Pistacia vera.</span>&mdash;The pistacia tree, which yields the eatable pistachio nuts. It
is a native of western Asia. The nuts are greatly eaten by the Turks and
Greeks, as well as in the south of Europe, either simply dried like almonds
or made into articles of confectionery.</p>

<p>349. <span class="smcap">Pithecolobium saman.</span>&mdash;This leguminous plant yields eatable pods, which are
fed to cattle in Brazil. Some Mexican species produce pods that are boiled
and eaten, and certain portions contain saponaceous properties. The pods
are sometimes called Manila tamarinds. The leaves of this tree fold closely
up at night, so that they do not prevent the radiation of heat from the surface
of the ground, and dew is therefore deposited underneath its branches.
The grass on the surface of the ground underneath this tree being thus wet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with dew, while that under other trees is found to be dry, has given it the
name of rain tree, under the supposition that the leaves dropped water
during the night.</p>

<p>350. <span class="smcap">Pittosporum undulatum.</span>&mdash;A plant from New Zealand, which reaches a considerable
size, and furnishes a wood similar to boxwood. The flowers are
very fragrant.</p>

<p>351. <span class="smcap">Plagianthus betulinus.</span>&mdash;The inner bark of the young branches of this plant
yields a very fine fiber, sometimes called New Zealand cotton, though more
like flax than cotton; it is the Akaroa of the New Zealanders. In Tasmania
it bears the name of Currajong. Good cordage and twine for fishing
nets are made from this fiber. A superior paper pulp is prepared from the
wood; it is also employed in making handles to baskets, rims for sieves, and
hoops for barrels.</p>

<p>352. <span class="smcap">Platonia insignis.</span>&mdash;A Brazilian tree which bears a fruit known in that
country as Pacoury-uva. The pulp of this fruit is semiacid, very delicious,
and is employed in making preserves. The seeds embedded in this pulp
have the flavor of almonds.</p>

<p>353. <span class="smcap">Plumbago scandens.</span>&mdash;The root of this plant is called Herbe du Diable in San
Domingo; it is acrid in the highest degree, and is a most energetic blistering
agent when fresh.</p>

<p>354. <span class="smcap">Plumeria alba.</span>&mdash;A South American plant. The flowers are used in perfumery,
and furnish the scent known as Frangipane or Frangipani. In
Jamaica the plant is known as red jasmine.</p>

<p>355. <span class="smcap">Pogostemon patchouly.</span>&mdash;This plant affords the celebrated patchouli perfume.
The peculiar odor of patchouli is disagreeable to some, but is very
popular with many persons. The odoriferous part of the plant is the
leaves and young tops, which yield a volatile oil by distillation, from which
an essence is prepared; satchels of patchouli are made of coarsely powdered
leaves. Genuine Indian shawls and Indian ink were formerly distinguished
by their odor of this perfume, but the test does not now hold good.
Ill effects, such as loss of sleep, nervous attacks, etc., have been ascribed
to its extensive use.</p>

<p>356. <span class="smcap">Pongamia glabra.</span>&mdash;Some years ago this tree was recommended as suitable
for avenue-planting in the south of France. In India an oil called poonga
is expressed from the seeds, which is much used for mixing with lamp oil.
It is of a deep yellow color, and is fluid at temperatures above 60&deg; F., but
below that it becomes solid.</p>

<p>357. <span class="smcap">Portlandia grandiflora.</span>&mdash;This plant belongs to the cinchonaceous family,
and is said to possess properties similar to those of the true cinchona. The
bark is exceedingly bitter.</p>

<p>358. <span class="smcap">Psidium cattleyanum.</span>&mdash;This is the purple guava from China. The fruits are
filled with juicy, pale flesh, of a very agreeable acid-sweet flavor.</p>

<p>359. <span class="smcap">Psidium pyriferum.</span>&mdash;The West Indian guava, a well-known fruit in the
tropics, but only known here in the shape of guava jelly. The wood of
the tree has a fine, close grain, and has been experimented with as a substitute
for boxwood for engraving purposes, but it is too soft to stand the
pressure of printing.</p>

<p>360. <span class="smcap">Psychotria leucantha.</span>&mdash;A plant belonging to the cinchona family. Emetic
properties are assigned to the roots, which are also used in dyeing. Native
of Peru.</p>

<p>361. <span class="smcap">Pterocarpus marsupium.</span>&mdash;This tree affords gum-kino, which is obtained by
making incisions in the bark, from which the juice exudes and hardens
into a brittle mass, easily broken into small angular, shining fragments of
a bright ruby color. It is highly astringent. The wood is hard and valuable
for manufacturing purposes.</p>

<p>362. <span class="smcap">Punica granatum.</span>&mdash;The pomegranate, a native of northern Africa and western
Asia. The fruit is valued in warm countries on account of its delicious
cooling and refreshing pulp. Numerous varieties are grown, some
being sweet and vinous, and others acid or of a bitter, stringent taste; the
color also varies from light to dark red. The bark of the root abounds
in a peculiar principle called <i>punicin</i>. This bark appears to have been
known to the ancients, and used by them as a vermifuge, and is still used
in Hindostan as a specific against tapeworm. The rind of the fruit of the
bitter varieties contains a large amount of tannin, and is used for tanning
morocco leather. The flowers yield a red dye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>363. <span class="smcap">Quassia amara.</span>&mdash;The wood of this plant furnishes Surinam quassia. It is
destitute of smell, but has an intensely bitter taste, and is used as a tonic.
The root has also reputed medicinal value, as also have the flowers.</p>

<p>364. <span class="smcap">Quillaja saponaria.</span>&mdash;The Quillai or Cully of the Chilians. Its bark is called
soap-bark, and is rough and dark-colored externally, but internally consists
of numerous regular whitish or yellowish layers, and contains a large
quantity of carbonate of lime and other mineral matters. It is also rich in
<i>saponine</i>, and is used for washing clothes; 2 ounces of the bark is sufficient
to wash a dress. It also removes all spots or stains, and imparts a fine
luster to wool; when powdered and rubbed between the hands in water, it
makes a foam like soap. It is to be found in commerce.</p>

<p>365. <span class="smcap">Randia aculeata.</span>&mdash;A small tree native of the West Indies, also found in
southern Florida. In the West Indies the fruit is used for producing a blue
dye, and medicinal properties are assigned to the bark.</p>

<p>366. <span class="smcap">Raphia t&aelig;digera.</span>&mdash;The Jupati palm. The leaf-stalks of this plant are used
by the natives of the Amazon for a variety of purposes, such as constructing
inside walls, making boxes and baskets, etc. <i>R. vinifera</i>, the Bamboo
palm, is similarly used by the Africans, who also make a very pliable cloth
of the undeveloped leaves. Palm wine is one of the products of the genus.</p>

<p>367. <span class="smcap">Ravenala madagascariensis.</span>&mdash;This plant is called the Traveler's tree, probably
on account of the water which is stored up in the large cup-like sheaths
of the leaf-stalks, and which is sought for by travelers to allay their thirst.
The broad leaves are used in Madagascar as thatch to cover their houses.
The seeds are edible, and the blue, pulpy aril surrounding them yields an
essential oil.</p>

<p>368. <span class="smcap">Rhapis flabelliformis.</span>&mdash;The ground rattan palm. This is supposed to
yield the walking-canes known as rattan, which is doubted. It is a native
of southern China, and is also found in Japan, where it is known by the
name of Kwanwortsik.</p>

<p>369. <span class="smcap">Rhizophora mangle.</span>&mdash;This plant is known as the mangrove, possibly because
no man can live in the swampy groves that are covered with it in tropical
countries. The seeds germinate, or form roots before they quit the
parent tree, and drop into the mud as young trees. The old plants send out
aerial roots into the water, upon which the mollusca adhere, and as the tide
recedes they are seen clinging to the shoots, verifying the statements of
old travelers that they had seen oysters growing on trees. All parts of this
tree contain tannin. The bark yields dyes, and in the West Indies the
leaves are used for poulticing wounds. The fruit is edible; a coarse, brittle
salt is extracted from the roots, and in the Philippines the bark is used as
a febrifuge.</p>

<p>370. <span class="smcap">Rottlera tinctoria.</span>&mdash;This plant belongs to the order <i>Euphorbiace&aelig;</i>, and
reaches the size of a small tree in the Indian Archipelago and southern
Australia. From the surface of the trilobed capsules of this plant, which
are about the size of peas, a red, mealy powder is obtained, well known in
India as kamala, and which is used by Hindoo silk-dyers, who obtain from
it a deep, bright, durable orange or flame color of great beauty. This is
obtained by boiling the powder in a solution of carbonate of soda. When
the capsules are ripe the red powder is brushed off and collected for sale,
no other preparation being necessary to preserve it. It is also used medicinally
as an anthelmintic and has been successfully used in cases of tapeworm.
A solution removes freckles and pustules and eruptions on the skin.</p>

<p>371. <span class="smcap">Ruellia indigotica.</span>&mdash;This small bush is extensively cultivated in China for
the preparation of a blue coloring-matter of the nature of indigo. The
pigment is prepared from the entire plant by a process similar to that employed
in procuring the common indigo. It is sold in China in a pasty
state. The water in which the plant is steeped is mixed with lime and
rapidly agitated, when the coloring deposits at the bottom of the vessel.</p>

<p>372. <span class="smcap">Sabal adansonii.</span>&mdash;This dwarf palm is a native of the Southern States. The
leaves are made into fans, and the soft interior of the stem is edible.</p>

<p>373. <span class="smcap">Sabal umbraculifera.</span>&mdash;This is a West Indian palm; the leaves are used for
various purposes, such as making mats, huts, etc.</p>

<p>374. <span class="smcap">Saccharum officinarum.</span>&mdash;The sugar cane. Where the sugar cane was first
cultivated is unknown, but it is supposed to have been in the East Indies,
for the Venetians imported it from thence by the Red Sea prior to the year
1148. It is supposed to have been introduced into the islands of Sicily, Crete,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Rhodes, and Cyprus by the Saracens, as abundance of sugar was made in
these islands previous to the discovery of the West Indies in 1492 by the
Spaniards, and the East Indies and Brazil by the Portuguese in 1497 and 1560.
It was cultivated afterwards in Spain, in Valentia, Granada, and Murcia
by the Moors. In the fifteenth century it was introduced into the Canary
Islands by the Spaniards and to Madeira by the Portuguese, and thence to
the West India Islands and to Brazil. The Dutch began to make sugar in
the island of St. Thomas in the year 1610 and in Jamaica in 1644. Its culture
has since become general in warm climates and its use universal.</p>

<p>375. <span class="smcap">Saguerus saccharifer.</span>&mdash;The arenga palm, which is of great value to the
Malays. The black horsehair like fiber surrounding its leaf-stalks is made
into cordage; a large amount of toddy or palm wine is obtained by cutting
off the flower spikes, which, when inspissated, affords sugar, and when fermented
a capital vinegar. Considerable quantities of inferior sago and several
other products of minor importance are derived from this palm.</p>

<p>376. <span class="smcap">Sagus rumphii.</span>&mdash;This palm produces the sago of commerce, which is prepared
from the soft inner portion of the trunk. It is obtained by cutting the
trunk into small pieces, which are split and the soft substance scooped out
and pounded in water till the starchy substance separates and settles. This
is sago meal; but before being exported it is made into what is termed
pearl sago. This is a Chinese process, principally carried on at Singapore.
The meal is washed, strained, and spread out to dry; it is then broken up,
pounded, and sifted until it is of a regular size. Small quantities being
then placed in bags, these are shaken about until it becomes granulated or
pearled.</p>

<p>377. <span class="smcap">Salvadora persica.</span>&mdash;This is supposed to be the plant that produced the
mustard seed spoken of in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>378. <span class="smcap">Sandoricum indicum.</span>&mdash;A tropical tree, sometimes called the Indian sandal
tree, which produces a fruit like an apple, of agreeable acid flavor. The
root of the tree has some medicinal value.</p>

<p>379. <span class="smcap">Sanseviera guineensis.</span>&mdash;Called the African bowstring hemp, from the fibers
of the leaves being used for bowstrings.</p>

<p>380. <span class="smcap">Santalum album.</span>&mdash;This tree yields the true sandalwood of India. This fragrant
wood is in two colors, procured from the same tree; the yellow-colored
wood is from the heart and the white-colored from the exterior, the latter
not so fragrant. The Chinese manufacture it into musical instruments,
small cabinets, boxes, and similar articles, which are insect proof. From
shavings of the wood an essential oil is distilled, which is used in perfumery.</p>

<p>381. <span class="smcap">Sapindus saponaria.</span>&mdash;The soapberry tree. The fruit of this plant is about
the size of a large gooseberry, the outer covering or shell of which contains
a saponaceous principle in sufficient abundance to produce a lather with
water and is used as a substitute for soap. The seeds are hard, black, and
round, and are used for making rosaries and necklaces, and at one time
were covered for buttons. Oil is also extracted from the seeds and is known
as soap oil.</p>

<p>382. <span class="smcap">Sapium indicum.</span>&mdash;A widely distributed Asiatic tree which yields an acrid,
milky juice, which, as also the leaves of the plant, furnishes a kind of dye.
The fruit in its green state is acid, and is eaten as a condiment in Borneo.</p>

<p>383. <span class="smcap">Sapota achras.</span>&mdash;The fruit of this plant is known in the West Indies as the
sapodilla plum. It is highly esteemed by the inhabitants; the bark of the
tree is astringent and febrifugal; the seeds are aperient and diuretic.</p>

<p>384. <span class="smcap">Sapota mulleri.</span>&mdash;The bully or balata tree of British Guiana, which furnishes
a gum somewhat intermediate between India rubber and gutta-percha,
being nearly as elastic as the first without the brittleness and friability of
the latter, and requiring a high temperature to melt or soften it.</p>

<p>385. <span class="smcap">Schinus molle.</span>&mdash;The root of this plant is used medicinally and the resin that
exudes from the tree is employed to astringe the gums. The leaves are so
filled with resinous fluid that when they are immersed in water it is expelled
with such violence as to have the appearance of spontaneous motion
in consequence of the recoil. The fruits are of the size of pepper corns and
are warm to the taste. The pulp surrounding the seeds is made into a kind
of beverage by the Mexican Indians. The plant is sometimes called Mexican
pepper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>386. <span class="smcap">Schotia speciosa.</span>&mdash;A small tree of South Africa called Boerboom at the Cape
of Good Hope. The seeds or beans are cooked and eaten as food. The
bark is used for tanning purposes and as an astringent in medicine.</p>

<p>387. <span class="smcap">Seaforthia elegans.</span>&mdash;This palm is a native of the northern part of Australia,
where it is utilized by the natives. The seeds have a granular fibrous rind,
and are spotted and marked like a nutmeg.</p>

<p>388. <span class="smcap">Selaginella lepidophylla.</span>&mdash;This species of club moss is found in southern
California, and has remarkable hygrometric qualities. Its natural growth
is in circular roseate form, and fully expanded when the air is moist, but
rolling up like a ball when it becomes dry. It remains green and acts in
this peculiar manner for a long time after being gathered. Of late years
numbers have been distributed throughout the country under the names of
"Rose of Jericho" and "Resurrection Plant." This is, however, quite distinct
from the true Rose of Jericho, <i>Anastatica hierochuntica</i>, a native of
the Mediterranean region, from Syria to Algeria. This plant, when growing
and in flower, has branches spread rigidly, but when the seed ripens
the leaves wither, and the whole plant becomes dry, each little branch
curling inward until the plant appears like a small ball; it soon becomes
loosened from the soil, and is carried by the winds over the dry plains, and
is often blown into the sea, where it at once expands. It retains this
property of expanding when moistened for at least ten years.</p>

<p>389. <span class="smcap">Semecarpus anacardium.</span>&mdash;The marking nut tree of India. The thick, fleshy
receptacle bearing the fruit is of a yellow color when ripe, and is roasted
and eaten. The unripe fruit is employed in making a kind of ink. The
hard shell of the fruit is permeated by a corrosive juice, which is used on
external bruises and for destroying warts. The juice, when mixed with
quick-lime, is used to mark cotton or linen with an indelible mark. When
dry it forms a dark varnish, and among other purposes it is employed,
mixed with pitch and tar, in the calking of ships. The seeds, called
Malacca beans, or marsh nuts, are eaten, and are said to stimulate the
mental powers, and especially the memory; and finally they furnish an oil
used in painting.</p>

<p>390. <span class="smcap">Serissa f&#339;tida.</span>&mdash;A cinchonaceous shrub, having strong astringent properties.
The roots are employed in cases of diarrhea, also in ophthalmia and
certain forms of ulcers. It is a native of Japan and China.</p>

<p>391. <span class="smcap">Shorea robusta.</span>&mdash;This tree produces the Saul wood of India, which has a
very high reputation, and is extensively employed for all engineering purposes
where great strength and toughness are requisite. It is stronger and
much heavier than teak. An oil is obtained from the seeds, and a resin
similar to Dammar resin is likewise obtained from the tree.</p>

<p>392. <span class="smcap">Sida pulchella.</span>&mdash;A plant of the mallow family; the bark contains fibrous
tissues available for the manufacture of cordage. The root of <i>S. acuta</i> is
esteemed by the Hindoos as a medicine, and particularly as a remedy for
snake bites. The light wood of these species is used to make rocket sticks.</p>

<p>393. <span class="smcap">Simaba cedron.</span>&mdash;A native of New Grenada, where it attains the size of a
small tree, and bears a large fruit containing one seed; this seed, which
looks like a blanched almond, is known in commerce as the cedron. As a
remedy for snake bites it has been known from time immemorial in New
Grenada. It is mentioned in the books of the seventeenth century. Recently
it has obtained a reputation as a febrifuge, but its value as an antidote to the
bites of snakes and scorpions is universally believed, and the inhabitants
carry a seed with them in all their journeyings; if they happen to be bitten
by any venomous reptile they scrape about two grains of the seed in brandy
or water and apply it to the wound, at the same time taking a like dose
internally. This neutralizes the most dangerous poisons.</p>

<p>394. <span class="smcap">Simaruba officinalis.</span>&mdash;This tree yields the drug known as Simaruba bark,
which is, strictly speaking, the rind of the root. It is a bitter tonic. It is
known in the West Indies as the mountain damson.</p>

<p>395. <span class="smcap">Siphonia elastica.</span>&mdash;The South American rubber plant, from which a great
portion of the caoutchouc of commerce is obtained. There are several
species of siphonia which, equally with the above, furnish the India
rubber exported from Para. The caoutchouc exists in the tree in the form
of a thin, white milk, which exudes from incisions made in the trunk, and
is poured over molds, which were formerly shaped like jars, bottles, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
shoes, hence often called bottle rubber. As it dries, the coatings of milky
juice are repeated until the required thickness is obtained, and the clay
mold removed. It belongs to the extensive family <i>Euphorbiace&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>396. <span class="smcap">Smilax medica.</span>&mdash;This plant yields <i>Mexican</i> sarsaparilla, so called to distinguish
it from the many other kinds of this drug. The plant is a climber,
similar to the smilax of our woods.</p>

<p>397. <span class="smcap">Spondias mombin.</span>&mdash;This yields an eatable fruit called hog plum in the West
Indies. The taste is said to be peculiar, and not very agreeable to strangers.
It is chiefly used to fatten swine. The fruit is laxative, the leaves astringent,
and the seeds possess poisonous qualities. The flower buds are
used as a sweetmeat with sugar.</p>

<p>398. <span class="smcap">Strelitzia regin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;A plant of the Musa or banana family. The flowers are
very beautiful for the genus. It is a native of the Cape of Good Hope.
The seeds are gathered and eaten by the Kaffirs.</p>

<p>399. <span class="smcap">Strychnos nux-vomica.</span>&mdash;This is a native of the Coromandel coast and
Cochin-China. It bears an orange-like fruit, containing seeds that have
an intensely bitter taste, owing to the presence of two most energetic poisons,
<i>strychnine</i> and <i>brucine</i>. The pulp surrounding the seeds is said to be
harmless, and greedily eaten by birds. The wood of the plant is hard and
bitter, and possesses similar properties to the seeds, but in a less degree. It
is used in India in intermittent fevers and in cases of snake bites. <i>S. tiente</i>
is a Java shrub, the juice of which is used in poisoning arrows. <i>S. toxifera</i>
yields a frightful poison called Ourari or Wourari, employed by the
natives of Guiana. This is considered to be the most potent sedative in
nature. Several species of <i>Strychnos</i> are considered infallible remedies for
snake bites; hence are known as snakewood. <i>S. pseudo-quina</i>, a native of
Brazil, yields Colpache bark, which is much used in that country in cases of
fever, and is considered equal to quinine in value. It does not contain
strychnine, and its fruits are edible. <i>S. potatorum</i> furnishes seeds known
in India as clearing-nuts, on account of their use in clearing muddy water.
St. Ignatius beans are supposed to be yielded by a species of Strychnos,
from the quantity of strychnine contained in the seeds.</p>

<p>400. <span class="smcap">Swietenia mahagoni.</span>&mdash;This South American plant furnishes the timber
known in commerce as mahogany. The bark is considered a febrifuge,
and the seeds prepared with oil were used by the ancient Aztecs as a cosmetic.
The timber is well known, and much used in the manufacture of
furniture.</p>

<p>401. <span class="smcap">Tacca pinnatifida.</span>&mdash;This is sometimes called South Sea arrowroot. The
tubers contain a great amount of starch, which is obtained by rasping
them and macerating four or five days in water, when the fecula separates
in the same manner as sago. It is largely used as an article of diet
throughout the tropics, and is a favorite ingredient for puddings and cakes.</p>

<p>402. <span class="smcap">Tamarindus indica.</span>&mdash;The tamarind tree. There are two varieties of this
species. The East Indian variety has long pods, with six to twelve seeds.
The variety cultivated in the West Indies has shorter pods, containing one
to four seeds. Tamarinds owe their grateful acidity to the presence of
citric, tartaric, and other vegetable acids. The pulp mixed with salt is
used for a liniment by the Creoles of the Mauritius. Every part of the
plant has had medicinal virtues ascribed to it. Fish pickled with tamarinds
are considered a great delicacy. It is said that the acid moisture
exhaled by the leaves injures the cloth of tents that remain under them
for any length of time. It is also considered unsafe to sleep under the
trees.</p>

<p>403. <span class="smcap">Tanghinia venenifera.</span>&mdash;This plant is a native of Madagascar, and of the
family <i>Apocynace&aelig;</i>. Formerly, when the custom of trial by ordeal was
more prevalent than now, the seeds of this plant were in great repute, and
unlimited confidence was placed in the poisonous seeds as a detector of
guilt. The seeds were pounded, and a small piece swallowed by each person
to be tried; those in whom it caused vomiting were allowed to escape,
but when it was retained in the stomach, it would quickly prove fatal, and
their guilt was thus held to be proven.</p>

<p>404. <span class="smcap">Tasmannia aromatica.</span>&mdash;The bark of this plant possesses aromatic qualities,
closely resembling Winter's bark. The small black fruits are used as a
substitute for pepper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>405. <span class="smcap">Tectona grandis.</span>&mdash;The teak tree. Teak wood has been extensively employed
for shipbuilding in the construction of merchant vessels and ships of war;
its great strength and durability, the facility with which it can be worked,
and its freedom from injury by fungi, rendering it peculiarly suitable for
these purposes. It is a native of the East India Islands, and belongs to the
order <i>Verbenace&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>406. <span class="smcap">Terminalia catappa.</span>&mdash;The astringent fruits of this tropical plant are employed
for tanning and dyeing, and are sometimes met with in commerce under
the name of myrobalans, and used by calico printers for the production of
a permanent black. The seeds are like almonds in shape and whiteness,
but, although palatable, have a peculiar flavor.</p>

<p>407. <span class="smcap">Tetranthera laurifolia.</span>&mdash;This plant is widely dispersed over tropical Asia
and the islands of the Eastern Archipelago. Its leaves and young branches
abound in a viscid juice, and in Cochin-China the natives bruise and macerate
them until this becomes glutinous, when it is used for mixing with
plaster, to thicken and render it more adhesive and durable. Its fruits
yield a solid fat, used for making candles, although it has a most disagreeable
odor.</p>

<p>408. <span class="smcap">Thea viridis.</span>&mdash;This is the China tea plant, whose native country is undetermined.
All kinds and grades of the teas of commerce are made from
this species, although probably it has some varieties. Black and green
teas are the result of different modes of preparation; very much of the
green, however, is artificially colored to suit the foreign trade. The finest
teas do not reach this country; they will not bear a sea voyage, and are
used only by the wealthy classes in China and Russia. The active principles
of the leaves are theine and a volatile oil, to which latter the flavor and
odor are due. So far as climate is concerned for the existence of the tea
plant in the United States, it will stand in the open air without injury
from Virginia southwards. A zero frost will not kill it. But with regard
to its production as a profitable crop, the rainfall in no portion of the States
is sufficient to warrant any attempt to cultivate the plant for commercial
purposes. But this does not prevent its culture as a domestic article, and
many hundreds of families thus prepare all the tea they require, from
plants it may be from the pleasure ground or lawn, where the plant forms
one of the best ornaments.</p>

<p>409. <span class="smcap">Theobroma cacao.</span>&mdash;This plant produces the well-known cacao, or chocolate,
and is very extensively cultivated in South America and the West India
Islands. The fruit, which is about 8 to 10 inches in length by 3 to 5 in
breadth, contains between fifty and a hundred seeds, and from these the cacao
is prepared. As an article of food it contains a large amount of nutritive
matter, about 50 per cent being fat. It contains a peculiar principle,
which is called <i>theobromine</i>.</p>

<p>410. <span class="smcap">Theophrasta jussi&aelig;i.</span>&mdash;A native of St. Domingo, where it is sometimes
called Le petit Coca. The fruit is succulent, and bread is made from the
seeds.</p>

<p>411. <span class="smcap">Thespesia populnea.</span>&mdash;A tropical tree, belonging to the mallow family. The
inner bark of the young branches yields a tough fiber, fit for cordage, and
used in Demerara for making coffee bags, and the finer pieces of it for cigar
envelopes. The wood is considered almost indestructible under water, and
its hardness and durability render it valuable for various purposes. The
flower buds and unripe fruits yield a viscid yellow juice, useful as a dye,
and a thick, deep, red-colored oil is expressed from the seeds.</p>

<p>412. <span class="smcap">Thevetia neriifolia.</span>&mdash;This shrubby plant is common in the West Indies
and in many parts of Central America. Its bark abounds in a poisonous
milky juice, and is said to possess powerful properties. A clear, bright,
yellow-colored oil, called Exile oil, is obtained, by expression, from the
seeds.</p>

<p>413. <span class="smcap">Thrinax argentea.</span>&mdash;This beautiful palm is called the Silver Thatch palm
of Jamaica, and is said to yield the leaves so extensively used in the manufacture
of hats, baskets, and other articles. It is also a native of Panama,
where it is called the broom palm, its leaves being there made into brooms.</p>

<p>414. <span class="smcap">Tillandsia zebrina.</span>&mdash;A South American plant of the pineapple family; the
bottle-like cavity at the base of the leaves will sometimes contain a pint or
more of water, and has frequently furnished a grateful drink to thirsty
travelers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>415. <span class="smcap">Tinospora cordifolia.</span>&mdash;A climbing plant, so tenacious of life that when
the stem is cut across or broken, a rootlet is speedily sent down from above,
which continues to grow until it reaches the ground. A bitter principle,
<i>calumbine</i>, pervades the plant. An extract called galuncha is prepared
from it, considered to be a specific for the bites of poisonous insects and for
ulcers. The young shoots are used as emetics.</p>

<p>416. <span class="smcap">Triphasia trifoliata.</span>&mdash;A Chinese shrub, with fruit about the size of hazelnuts,
red-skinned, and of an agreeable sweet taste; when green, they have
a strong flavor of turpentine, and the pulp is very sticky. They are also
preserved whole in sirup, and are sometimes called limeberries.</p>

<p>417. <span class="smcap">Tristania neriifolia.</span>&mdash;A myrtaceous plant from Australia, called the turpentine
tree, owing to its furnishing a fluid resembling that product.</p>

<p>418. <span class="smcap">Urceola elastica.</span>&mdash;A plant belonging to the <i>Apocynace&aelig;</i>, a native of the
islands of Borneo and Sumatra, where its milky juice, collected by making
incisions in its soft, thick, rugged bark, or by cutting the trunk into junks,
forms one of the kinds of caoutchouc called juitawan, but it is inferior to
the South American, chiefly owing to want of care in its preparation, the
milky juice being simply coagulated by mixing with salt water, instead of
being gradually inspissated in layers on a mold. The fruit contains a pulp
which is much eaten by the natives.</p>

<p>419. <span class="smcap">Urena lobata.</span>&mdash;A malvaceous plant, possessing mucilaginous properties, for
which it is used medicinally. The bark affords an abundance of fiber, resembling
jute rather than flax or hemp.</p>

<p>420. <span class="smcap">Uvaria odoratissima.</span>&mdash;An Indian plant which is supposed to yield the essential
oil called Ylang-Ylang, or Alan-gilan. This oil is obtained by distillation
from the flowers, and is highly esteemed by perfumers, having an exquisite
odor partaking of the jasmine and lilac.</p>

<p>421. <span class="smcap">Vangueria edulis.</span>&mdash;A cinchonaceous plant, the fruits of which are eaten in
Madagascar under the name of Voa-vanga. The leaves are used in medicine.</p>

<p>422. <span class="smcap">Vanilla planifolia.</span>&mdash;The vanilla plant, which belongs to the orchid family.
The fruit is used by confectioners and others for flavoring creams, liquors,
and chocolates. There are several species, but this gives the finest fruit. It
is a climbing orchid, and is allowed to climb on trees when cultivated for its
fruit. In Mexico, from whence is procured a large portion of the fruit, it
is cultivated in certain favorable localities near the Gulf coast, where the
climate is warm. Much of the value of the bean depends upon the process
of its preparation for the market. In Mexico, where much care is given to
this process, the pods are gathered before they are fully ripe and placed in
a heap, under protection from the weather, until they begin to shrivel, when
they are submitted to a sweating process by wrapping them in blankets inclosed
in tight boxes; afterwards they are exposed to the sun. They are
then tied into bundles or small bales, which are first wrapped in woolen
blankets, then in a coating of banana leaves first sprinkled with water, then
placed in an oven heated up to about 140&deg; F. Here they remain for twenty-four
to forty-eight hours, according to the size of the pods, the largest requiring
the longest time. After this heating they are exposed to the sun
daily for fifty or sixty days, until they are thoroughly dried and ready for
the market.</p>

<p>423. <span class="smcap">Vateria indica.</span>&mdash;This plant yields a useful gum resin, called Indian copal,
piney varnish, white dammar, or gum anine. The resin is procured by cutting
a notch in the tree, so that the juice may flow out and become hardened.
It is used as a varnish for pictures, carriages, etc. On the Malabar coast it
is manufactured into candles, which burn with a clear light and an agreeable
fragrance. The Portuguese employ this resin instead of incense. Ornaments
are fashioned from it under the name of amber. It is also employed
in medicine.</p>

<p>424. <span class="smcap">Weinmannia racemosa.</span>&mdash;A New Zealand tree called Towhia by the natives
of that country. Its bark is used for tanning purposes, and as a red and
brown dye, which give fast colors upon cotton fabrics.</p>

<p>425. <span class="smcap">Wrightia tinctoria.</span>&mdash;The leaves of this plant furnish an inferior kind of indigo.
The wood is beautifully white, close-grained, and ivory-like, and is
much used for making Indian toys.</p>

<p>426. <span class="smcap">Xanthorrh&#339;a arborea.</span>&mdash;The grass gum tree of Australia, also called black
boy. This is a liliaceous plant, which produces a long flower-stalk, bearing
at the top an immense cylindrical flower-spike, and when the short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
black stem is denuded of leaves, the plants look very like black men holding
spears. The leaves afford good fodder for cattle, and the tender white
center is used as a vegetable. A fragrant resin, called acaroid resin, is obtained
from it.</p>

<p>427. <span class="smcap">Ximenia americana.</span>&mdash;A small tree, found in many warm regions; among
others in southern Florida. In Brazil it is called the Native Plum on
account of its small yellow fruits, which have a subacid and somewhat
astringent aromatic taste. The wood is odoriferous and is used in the West
Indies as a substitute for sandalwood.</p>

<p>428. <span class="smcap">Yucca al&#339;folia.</span>&mdash;The yucca leaves afford a good fiber, and some southern
species are known as <i>bear's grass</i>. The root stems also furnish a starchy
matter, which has been rendered useful in the manufacture of starch.</p>

<p>429. <span class="smcap">Zamia furfuracea.</span>&mdash;This plant belongs to the order <i>Cycadace&aelig;</i>, and is
grown to some extent for the starchy matter contained in the stem, which
is collected and used as arrowroot; but it is not the true arrowroot, that

<p>430. <span class="smcap">Zamia integrifolia.</span>&mdash;The coontie plant of Florida. The large succulent
roots afford a quantity of arrowroot, said to be equal to the best of that
from Bermuda. The fruit has a coating of an orange-colored pulp, which
is said to form a rich edible food. It was from the roots of this plant that
the Seminoles of Florida obtained their <i>white meal</i>.</p>

<p>431. <span class="smcap">Zingiber officinale.</span>&mdash;This plant is cultivated in most warm countries for
the sake of its rhizomes, which furnish the spice called ginger. It is prepared
by digging up the roots when a year old, scraping them, and drying
them in the sun. Ginger, when broken across, shows a number of little
fibers embedded in floury tissue. Its hot pungent taste is due to a volatile
oil. It also contains starch and yellow coloring matter. Ginger is used
for various medicinal purposes, and in many ways as a condiment, and in
the preparation of cordials and so-called teas.</p></div>
